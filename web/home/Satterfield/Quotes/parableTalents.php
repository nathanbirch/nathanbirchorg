                                In April of 1843, the Prophet told Benjamin F. Johnson &#8220;that he would
                                preach a sermon that day for me, which I would understand, while the
                                rest of the congregation would not comprehend his meaning. His subject
                                was the ten talents spoken of by the Savior, &#8216;unto him that hath shall
                                be given, and he shall have abundantly, but from that hath not (or will
                                not receive) shall be taken away that which he hath, (or might have
                                had.)&#8217; Plainly giving me to understand that the talents represented
                                wives and children as the principle of enlargement throughout the great
                                future, to those who were heirs of Salvation&#8221;</big><small><big> (Andrew
