                        Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the
                        spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their
                        house--and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be
                        weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their
                        own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.</big></big></p>

                        upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in

                        there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the
                        spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus
                        while they lived in mortality;</big></big></p>

                        these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious
                        resurrection, through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten
                        Son, Jesus Christ.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>15 I beheld
                        that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing

                        to be united never again to be divided, that they might receive a
                        fulness of joy.</big></big></p>

                        their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared,
                        declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful;</big></big></p>

                        there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the

                        individual sins on conditions of repentance.</big></big></p>

                        of all men, as soon as they depart from this mortal body, whether they
                        are good or evil, we are told in the Book of Mormon, are taken home to
                        that God who gave them life, where there is a separation, a partial
                        judgment, and the spirits of those who are righteous are received into
                        a state of happiness which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state
                        of peace, where they expand in wisdom, where they have respite from all
                        their troubles, and where care and sorrow do not annoy. The wicked, on
                        the contrary, have no part nor portion in the Spirit of the Lord, and
                        they are cast into outer darkness, being led captive, because of their
                        own iniquity, by the evil one. And in this space between death and the
                        resurrection of the body, the two classes of souls remain, in happiness
                        or in misery, until the time which is appointed of God that the dead
                        shall come forth and be reunited both spirit and body, and be brought
                        to stand before God, and be judged according to their works. This is
                        the final judgment. <small>(<em>Gospel Doctrine</em>, p. 448)</small></big></big><br

                        the fall of Adam, which ushered death into this world, our Heavenly
                        Father had prepared a place for the spirits who would eventually depart
                        this mortal life. At the time of Jesus' death, the spirit world was
                        occupied by hosts of our Father's children who had died - from Adam's
                        posterity to the death of Jesus - both the righteous and the wicked.
                        There were two grand divisions in the world of spirits. Spirits of the
                        righteous (the just) had gone to paradise, a state of happiness, peace,
                        and restful work. The spirits of the wicked (the unjust) had gone to
                        prison, a state of darkness and misery. (See Alma 40: 12-15.) Jesus
                        went only to the righteous - to paradise. <small>(<em>Teachings of

                        from the vision given to President Joseph F. Smith and found in <em>Gospel

                        from these words that <em>rest</em> means no work and merely languid
                        passivity. In fact, the <em>rest</em> described is from the troubles,
                        cares, and sorrows of this world.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>To begin
                        with, a certain peacefulness and restfulness will occur in paradise,
                        because the faithful will see things with a more complete, restful, and
                        reassuring perspective. Nonetheless, the faithful will soon be caught
                        up fully and be "anxiously engaged" in the vast work underway in al the
                        spirit world (D&amp;C 58:27). So many of the cares and demands of the
                        of the world which press upon us here and now, including doing the
                        chores of this world, will not dominate us there. Hence, paradise will
                        be, comparatively, "a state of peace." Furthermore, the spirit body
                        will not suffer certain of the ills and constraints which now beset the
                        mortal body. The result will be added zestfulness there, as described
                        by Elder John Taylor: "[Death] this dark shadow and valley is so
                        trifling . . . [one is] passed from a state of sorrow [and] grief, . .
                        . into a state of existence where I can enjoy life to the fullest
                        extent as far as that can be done without a body. . . . I thirst no
                        more, I want to sleep no more, I hunger no more, I tire no more, I run,
                        I walk, I labor, . . . nothing like pain or weariness, I am full of
                        life, full of vigor" ("Discourse by Elder John Taylor." <em>Deseret

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>He said he
                        had prepared a prison for them, because of their disobedience, and
                        would shut them in it. There they would remain until the time when they
                        should be visited by the Son of God, when he should again carry to them
                        that message which they rejected from Noah.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>We read in
                        the scriptures that the Son of God, after his death, went to the
                        spirits in prison and taught them the principles of the gospel, that
                        they might live according to God in the spirit and be judged according
                        to men in the flesh. Those very same spirits, who were disobedient in
                        the days of Noah, heard the voice of the Son of God when he went to
                        them, while his body was in the tomb, and all who were willing to
                        receive his testimony and obey his commandments received relief from
                        their torment.</big></big></p>

                        the time of their death in the flood until the time of the crucifixion
                        of the Savior, they were shut up in the prison house in torment,
                        suffering the penalty of their transgressions, because they refused to
                        hear a prophet of the Lord - and so it will be with every man who

                            the objection made, from time to time, that Jesus did not come to save
                            the dead, for he most emphatically declared himself that there was an
                            impassable gulf that separated the righteous spirits from the wicked.
                            In defense of their position they quote the words in Luke: "And beside
                            all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they
                            which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us,
                            that would come from thence."</big></big></div>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>These
                        words, according to the story, were spoken by Abraham's spirit to the
                        rich man who raised his eyes and asked that Lazarus might go touch his
                        lips and relieve his torment. Abraham replied that it could not be for
                        there was a gulf fixed between them that the spirit of no man could
                        pass. Therefore, say the objectors to the doctrine of universal
                        salvation, "It is quite evident that the righteous and the wicked who
                        are dead cannot visit each other, hence there is no salvation for the
                        dead."</big></big></p>

                        true before the days that Jesus atoned for sin, which is plainly shown

                        this period this event occurred. However, Christ came and through his
                        death bridged that gulf, proclaimed liberty to the captives, and the
                        opening of this prison door to those who sat in darkness and captivity.</big></big></p>

                        Paradise is not heaven, or the place where God dwells, but a place of
                        departed spirits. Why the belief should be so general that the thief
                        went to heaven with the Savior is rather strange, since Jesus did not
                        go there until after his resurrection. This fact he disclosed to Mary
                        at the tomb. From the time his spirit left his body until he arose from
                        the tomb, Jesus was with the thief in paradise, according to his
                        promise. There the Savior opened the door for the salvation of the
                        dead. Before that time the unworthy dead were shut up in prison and
                        were not visited. (Moses 7:38-39; Isaiah 24:22.) We have good reason to
                        believe that the righteous spirits in paradise did not mingle with the
                        unrighteous spirits before the visit of our Lord to the spirit world.
                        He declared that there was a gulf fixed that could not be crossed which
                        separated the righteous from the unrighteous, therefore there was no
                        sound of the voice of prophets and the Gospel was not declared among
                        the wicked until Christ went into that world before his resurrection.
                        He it was who opened the prison doors. - Isaiah 42:6-7; 61:1.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>President
                        Brigham Young declared that "Jesus was the first man that ever went to
                        preach to the spirits in prison, holding the keys of the Gospel of
                        salvation to them. Those keys were delivered to him in the day and hour
                        that he went into the spirit world, and with them he opened the door of
                        salvation to the spirits in prison." (J.D. 4:285.) This is in full
                        accord with the scriptures. President Joseph F. Smith, in the vision he
                        beheld of the spirit world, confirmed this view. (<em>Gos. Doc</em>.,
                        pp. 596-601.) In that world Christ taught the righteous spirits and
                        commissioned them to carry his message and sent them forth among the
                        unbaptized dead. In this way he fulfilled his promise made to Isaiah
                        that he would preach to the spirits of the dead and open their prison
                        doors that they might go free. <small>(<em>The Way to Perfection</em>,

                    <big><big>The spirit prison is hell, that portion of the spirit world
                            where the wicked dwell. (Moses 7:37-39.) Before Christ bridged the gulf
                            between paradise and hell - so that the righteous could mingle with the
                            wicked and preach them the gospel - the wicked in hell were confined to
                            locations which precluded them from contact with the righteous in
                            paradise. Abraham told the rich man in hell that between him and
                            Lazarus (who was in paradise) there was a great gulf fixed so that none
                            could go from paradise to hell or from hell to paradise. (Luke
                            16:19-31.) Now that the righteous spirits in paradise have been
                            commissioned to carry the message of salvation to the wicked spirits in
                            hell, there is a certain amount of mingling together of the good and
                            bad spirits. Repentance opens the prison doors to the spirits in hell;
                            it enables those bound with the chains of hell to free themselves from
                            darkness, unbelief, ignorance, and sin. As rapidly as they can overcome
                            these obstacles - gain light, believe truth, acquire intelligence, cast
                            off sin, and break the chains of hell - they can leave the hell that
                            imprisons them and dwell with the righteous in the peace of paradise. <small>(<em>Mormon

                            By spirit world is meant the abiding place of disembodied spirits,
                            those who have passed from pre-existence to mortality and have also
                            gone on from this temporal world to another sphere to await the day of
                            their resurrection, final redemption, and judgment. This world is
                            divided into two parts: paradise which is the abode of the righteous,
                            and hell which is the abode of the wicked. (Alma 40:11-14.)</big></big>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Until the
                        death of Christ these two spirit abodes were separated by a great gulf,
                        with the intermingling of their respective inhabitants strictly
                        forbidden. (Luke 16:19-31.) After our Lord bridged the gulf between the
                        two (1 Pet. 3:18-21; Moses 7:37-39), the affairs of his kingdom in the
                        spirit world were so arranged that righteous spirits began teaching the
                        gospel to wicked ones. (<em>Gospel Doctrine</em>, 5th ed., pp. 473-476.)</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Thus,
                        although there are two spheres within the one spirit world, there is
                        now some intermingling of the righteous and the wicked who inhabit
                        those spheres; and when the wicked spirits repent, they leave their
                        prison-hell and join the righteous in paradise. Hence, we find Joseph
                        Smith saying: "Hades, sheol, paradise, spirits in prison, are all one:
                        it is a world of spirits. The righteous and the wicked all go to the
                        same world of spirits until the resurrection." (<em>Teachings</em>, p.
