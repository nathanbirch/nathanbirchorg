                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>25 I
                        marveled, for I understood that the Savior spent about three years in
                        his ministry among the Jews and those of the house of Israel,
                        endeavoring to teach them the everlasting gospel and call them unto
                        repentance;</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>26 And yet,
                        notwithstanding his mighty works, and miracles, and proclamation of the
                        truth, in great power and authority, there were but few who hearkened
                        to his voice, and rejoiced in his presence, and received salvation at
                        his hands.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>27 But his
                        ministry among those who were dead was limited to the brief time
                        intervening between the crucifixion and his resurrection;</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>28 And I
                        wondered at the words of Peter--wherein he said that the Son of God
                        preached unto the spirits in prison, who sometime were disobedient,
                        when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah--and how
                        it was possible for him to preach to those spirits and perform the
                        necessary labor among them in so short a time.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>29 And as I
                        wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I
                        perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the
                        disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>30 But
                        behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed
                        messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to
                        go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in
                        darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel
                        preached to the dead.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>31 And the
                        chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord
                        and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all who
                        would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>32 Thus was
                        the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without a
                        knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the
                        prophets.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>36 Thus was
                        it made known that our Redeemer spent his time during his sojourn in
                        the world of spirits, instructing and preparing the faithful spirits of
                        the prophets who had testified of him in the flesh;</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>37 That
                        they might carry the message of redemption unto all the dead, unto whom
                        he could not go personally, because of their rebellion and
                        transgression, that they through the ministration of his servants might
                        also hear his words.<br>

                        were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for
                        the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of
                        hands,</big></big></p>

                        emphasized is vicarious baptism for the dead, because that ordinance is
                        absolutely essential for their cleansing and salvation. Furthermore,
                        the recipients can there by qualify to become members of The Church of
                        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by developing sufficient faith and
                        also by showing sufficient repentance in the spirit world. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Typically,
                        in that connection, we here do not emphasize as much the other
                        essential part of what can happen vicariously - confirming Church
                        membership and the bestowal of the great gift of the Holy Ghost.
                        Because the accompanying and essential ordinances remain to be
                        accomplished vicariously on our side of the veil, it would be well if
                        more of the intensity characteristic of the work in the spirit world
                        were displayed by us in mortality. Indeed, the gifts of the Holy Ghost
                        also help recipients there to lend a hand and to function more

                            Church members suffer from a lack of perspective, perhaps
                            understandably, as to the vastness and intensity of the Lord's work in
                            the spirit world. The scope is enormous! Demographers estimate that
                            some sixty to seventy billion people have lived on this planet thus
                            far. Without diminishing in any way the importance of the absolutely
                            vital and tandem work on this side of the veil, we do need a better
                            grasp of "things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). Otherwise, we
                            can so easily come to regard family history as a quaint hobby and its
                            resulting temple work as something we will get around to later. Not
                            only does the word <em>vastness</em> characterize the work there but
                            so does <em>intensity</em>. <small>(<em>The Promise of Discipleship</em>,

                                Is one reason we are not told more about the details of God's work in
                                the spirit world perhaps the intimidating larger scale of things there?
                                The scope of the work there is so large that it might embarrass those
                                of us here. Probably twelve times the earth's present population live
                                there. For sure, twelve times as many Presidents of the Church in this
                                dispensation alone are in residence and at work there! Perhaps God thus
                                protects us in our present provinciality from feeling diminished by
                                considerations of scale. <small>(</small></span><small><em

                        is a term which means a place of departed spirits according to the

                        the wicked were shut up in darkness and were not visited. In this awful
                        state they suffered the torment of their consciences not knowing what
                        their fate would be, just as Alma has pictured it. We are given further
                        light on the condition of the wicked in this spirit world from the
                        words of the Lord to Enoch.</big></big></p>

                        paragraphs we learn that the Lord does not delight in punishment,
                        however there is the demand of justice which must be met, and therefore
                        the wicked are forced to suffer, and this suffering helps to cleanse
                        them from their sins. Before the visit of our Savior to the spirit
                        world there was a gulf separating the righteous from the wicked, and
                        the wicked were evidently without knowledge as to what fate awaited
                        them. (Luke 16:19-31.) Savior after his crucifixion bridged this gulf
                        and the gospel was carried to those who sat in this darkness and
                        through the instruction of those who held the priesthood, these
                        miserable spirits were taught the gospel. They were granted some
                        measure of blessing according to their works on earth and according to
                        their opportunity or lack of it, to hear the gospel when living on the
                        earth, and accept the same in the spirit world. <small>(<em>Answers to

                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big>Why did he preach to these
                            disobedient spirits? Surely not to increase their torments, to taunt
                            them for not accepting of his truth in the days of the prophets! Was it
                            to tantalize them and make them more miserable because of the blessings
                            they had lost! Jesus was a merciful Redeemer, who suffered as no other
                            man suffered that he might save the children of his Father. He would
                            take no pleasure in the suffering of the wicked.</big></big></div>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>It was his
                        nature to plead for them, to entreat his Father for mercy in their
                        behalf. Therefore, whatever his mission was, it was one of mercy and
                        comfort to those prisoners. Peter tells us that the object of his visit
                        was that the gospel might be preached also to the dead, "that they
                        might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to
                        God in the spirit."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The visit
                        of Christ to the spirits in prison was not made in vengeance, to show
                        them that he had power to triumph over the grave, while they, who died
                        without the remission of their sins, should remain in that condition of
                        punishment forever. He took the glorious message of the gospel and
                        proclaimed it to the dead with the promise that they, if they would
                        obey it, should partake of its blessings.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>What good
                        reason can be given why the Lord should not forgive sins in the world
                        to come? Why should man suffer throughout the countless ages of
                        eternity for his sins committed here, if those sins are not unto death?
                        There are many good, honorable men who have wilfully wronged no man,
                        have lived to the best of their opportunities, righteously, yet have
                        not received the gospel, for one reason or another. Where would be the
                        justice in condemning them forever in hell, "where their worm dieth
                        not, and the fire is not quenched?"</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>We learn
                        from the Doctrine and Covenants that eternal punishment, or everlasting
                        punishment, does not mean that a man condemned will endure this
                        punishment forever, but it is everlasting and eternal because it is
                        God's punishment, and he is Everlasting and Eternal. Therefore, when a
                        man pays the penalty of his misdeeds and humbly repents, receiving the
                        gospel, he comes out of the prison house and is assigned to some degree
                        of glory according to his worth and merit. . . .</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>That sins
                        are forgiven in the world to come, we need only refer to the words of
                        the Savior: "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
                        men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven
                        unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it
                        shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost,
                        it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the
                        world to come."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>This shows
                        that some sins will be forgiven in the world to come. We are also
                        informed in First Corinthians that, "If in this life only we have hope
                        in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But we have hope in Christ
                        both in this life and in the life to come. <small>(<em>Doctrines of

                        spirit world and organized this dispensation on that side of the veil;
                        he is gathering together the elders of Israel and the Saints of God in
                        the spirit world, for they have a work to do there as well as here.
                        Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Father Smith, David Patten and the other elders
                        who have been called to the other side of the veil have fifty times as
                        many people to preach to as we have on the earth. There they have all
                        the spirits who have lived on the earth in seventeen centuries - fifty
                        generations, fifty thousand millions of persons who lived and died here
                        without having seen a prophet or apostle, and without having the word
                        of the Lord sent unto them. They are shut up in prison, awaiting the
                        message of the elders of Israel. We have only about a thousand millions
                        of people on the earth, but in the spirit world they have fifty
                        thousand millions; and there is not a single revelation which gives us
                        any reason to believe that any man who enters the spirit world preached
                        the gospel there to those who lived after him; but they all preach to
                        men who were in the flesh before they were. Jesus himself preached to
                        the antediluvian world, who had been in prison for thousands of years.
                        So with Joseph Smith and the elders - they will have to preach to the
                        inhabitants of the earth who have died during the last seventeen
                        centuries; and when they hear the testimony of the elders and accept it
                        there should be somebody on the earth, as we have been told, to attend
                        to the ordinances of the house of God for them. <small>(<em>The

                            same priesthood exists on the other side of the veil. Every man who is
                            faithful is in his quorum there. When a man dies and his body is laid
                            in the tomb, he does not lose his position. The prophet Joseph Smith
                            held the keys of this dispensation on this side of the veil, and he
                            will hold them throughout the countless ages of eternity. He went into
                            the spirit world to unlock the prison doors and to preach the gospel to
                            the millions of spirits who are in darkness, and every apostle, every
                            seventy, every elder, etc., who has died in the faith, as soon as he
                            passes to the other side of the veil, enters into the work of the
                            ministry, and there is a thousand times more to preach there than there

                                I have felt of late as if our brethren on the other side of the veil
                                had held a council, and that they had said to this one, and that one,
                                "Cease thy work on earth, come hence, we need help," and they have
                                called this man and that man. It has appeared so to me in seeing the
                                many men who have been called from our midst lately. <small>(</small></span><small><em

                                when he goes into the spirit world his works follow him, and he rests
                                in peace. The priesthood is not taken from him, and he has thousands
                                more to preach to there than he ever had here in the flesh. But it
                                depends upon the living here to erect temples, that the ordinances for
                                the dead may be attended to, for by and by you will meet your

                        There, billions must hear the gospel preached. Joseph F. Smith, sixth
                        President of the Church, received this revelation: "I beheld that the
                        faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal
                        life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of
                        repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten
                        Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of
                        sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead" (D&amp;C 138:57).

                        have the perfect peace and assurance that our Heavenly Father's will

                        over the great redemptive work for the dead. Before the Savior can
                        present this kingdom to His Father, all the descendants of Shem, Ham
                        and Japheth who have not received the gospel in the flesh must have the
                        opportunity to hear the gospel. That work is going forward on the other
                        side of the veil with greater acceleration than it is here. Our work is
                        to officiate in the temples of God for them. We don't build temples
                        until the Church is well established in a country. Our predecessors
                        have prophesied that temples will dot the landscape of North and South
                        America, the isles of the Pacific, Europe, and elsewhere. If this
                        redemptive work is to be done on the scale it must be, hundreds of
                        temples will be needed. Our first step then is to see that nations are
                        opened to receive the gospel so that stakes may be established. <small>(<em>Teachings

                        here that in my dreams I have had a great many visits from the Prophet
                        Joseph since his death. The last time I met him was in the spirit
                        world. I met him at the Temple. He spoke to me. Calling me by name, he
                        said, "I cannot stop to talk to you, for I am in a hurry." I met Father
                        Smith. He, too, said to me, "I am in a hurry." I met a great many of
                        the Apostles and others who are in the spirit world, and they all
                        seemed to be in a hurry. I marveled at this, and wondered very greatly
                        in my mind why anybody should be in a hurry in the Paradise of God.</big></big></p>

                        interview with the Prophet Joseph afterwards and asked him the
                        question, "Why are you all in such a hurry here?" I said, "I have
                        always been in a hurry in the world since I was born, but I thought
                        there would be no occasion for it when I died and entered the spirit
                        world." He replied, "Well, I will tell you: The Prophets and Apostles
                        in this dispensation have had no time nor opportunity to prepare
                        themselves to go to the earth with the great bridegroom when He goes to
                        meet the bride, the Lamb's wife. We in this dispensation have not had
                        time. We have first as much work to perform, to prepare ourselves, as
                        in other dispensations." </big></big></p>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>It is
                        intended that, in these sacred and holy places, appointed, set apart
                        and dedicated by the command of the Almighty, genealogies shall be
                        revealed, and that the living shall officiate for the dead, that those
                        who have not had the opportunity while in the flesh in past generations
                        to obey the Gospel, might have their friends now living, officiate for
                        them. This does not destroy their agency, for although they laid down
                        their bodies and went to their graves in a day of darkness, and they
                        are now mingled with the hosts of spirits in the eternal worlds, their
                        agency still continues, and that agency gives them power to believe in
                        Jesus Christ there, just as well as we can who are here. Those spirits
                        on the other side of the veil can repent just the same as we, in the
                        flesh, can repent. Faith in God and in his son Jesus Christ, and
                        repentance are acts of the mind--mental operations--but when it comes
                        to baptism for the remission of sins they cannot perform that, we act
                        for them, that having been ordained to be performed in the flesh. They
                        can receive the benefit of whatever is done for them here, and whatever
                        the Lord God commands his people here in the flesh to do for them will
                        be published to them there by those holding the everlasting Priesthood
                        of the Son of God. If, when the Gospel is preached to them there, they
                        will believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, they will receive the benefits
                        of the ordinances performed on their behalf here, and they will be
                        partakers, with their kindred, of all the blessings of the fullness of
                        the Gospel of the Son of God; but if they will not do this they will be
                        bound over in chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day,
                        when they will be judged according to men in the flesh. We are here in
                        the flesh, and the same Gospel that condemns the disobedient and the
                        sinner here, will, by the same law, condemn those who are on the other
                        side of the veil. <small>(<em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 15:51)</small><br>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Another
                        principle connected with this subject I want to talk about. A man has
                        married a woman, and they have a family of children. The man lays down
                        in death without ever hearing the Gospel. The wife afterwards hears the
                        Gospel and embraces it. She comes to the temple and she wants to be
                        sealed to her husband, who was a good man. The feeling has been to deny
                        this and to say, "No, he is not in the Church, and you cannot be sealed
                        to your husband." Many a woman's heart has ached because of this, and
                        as a servant of God I have broken that chain a good while ago. I have
                        laid before every woman this principle and let her have her choice. Why
                        deprive a woman of being sealed to her husband because he never heard
                        the Gospel? What do any of us know with regard to him? Will he not hear
                        the Gospel and embrace it in the spirit world? Look at Joseph Smith.
                        Not one of Joseph Smith's fathers or brothers or sisters were in the
                        covenant when he received the keys of the kingdom of God and translated
                        the Book of Mormon. They afterwards received it. Every brother and
                        sister that he had, and his father and his father's brothers, except
                        Uncle Jesse Smith, embraced the Gospel. Now, suppose that any of these
                        had died before they had the opportunity of entering into the covenant
                        with the Lord through the Gospel, as his brother Alvin did; they would
                        have been in the same position as Alvin, concerning whom the Lord, when
                        Joseph saw him in the celestial kingdom, said: "All who have died
                        without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would have received it if they
                        had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of
                        God; also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who
                        would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that
                        kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works,
                        according to the desire of their hearts."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>So it will
                        be with your fathers. There will be very few, if any, who will not
                        accept the Gospel. Jesus while His body lay in the tomb, went and
                        preached to the spirits in prison, who were destroyed in the days of
                        Noah. After so long an imprisonment, in torment, they doubtless gladly
                        embraced the Gospel, and if so they will be saved in the kingdom of
                        God. The fathers of this people will embrace the Gospel. It is my duty
                        to honor my father who begot me in the flesh. It is your duty to do the
                        same. When you do this, the Spirit of God will be with you. <small>(<em>Messages

                        learn that through revelation; and that being true, then we reach the
                        conclusion, unless we have been adopted through the gospel and were
                        gentiles, that our ancestors were also of the house of Israel. In other
                        words, the promise made to Abraham, that through the scattering of his
                        seed all nations would be blessed, has been fulfilled, and our lineage
                        has come down generation after generation through the loins of Abraham

                        to them there. Consider the comments of the Prophet Joseph Smith about
                        the important role of spiritual knowledge:</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"Knowledge
                        does away darkness, suspense and doubt, for where Knowledge is there is
                        no doubt nor suspense nor darkness. There is no pain so awful as the
                        pain of suspense. This is the condemnation of the wicked; their doubt
                        and anxiety and suspense causes weeping and gnashing of teeth."[Joseph
                        Smith, <em>The Words of Joseph Smith</em>. A. Ehat, and L. Cook
                        (Ed.s). Provo, UT: Grandin, 1991, p. 183] </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The "pain
                        of suspense" apparently will necessarily operate to some extent in the
                        spirit prison because of uncertainty-along with a price to be paid as
                        part of repentance for transgressions. The Prophet Joseph also said:</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"A man is
                        his own tormentor and his own condemner. Hence the saying, They shall
                        go into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. The torment of
                        disappointment in the mind of man is as exquisite as a lake burning
                        with fire and brimstone. I say, so is the torment of man." [Joseph

                        prison carries with it the connotation of "a state of confinement,"
                        including a conceptual confinement. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, for
                        instance, that God has "made ample provision for their redemption,
                        according to their several circumstance, . . . Whether in this world,

                        also consoled: "God has administrators in the eternal world to release
                        those spirits from Prison. The ordinances being administered by proxy
                        upon them, the law is fulfilled." [Joseph Smith, <em>The Words of
