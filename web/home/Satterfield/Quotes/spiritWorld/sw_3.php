                        the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return
                        unto God who gave it" (Ecclesiastes 12:7). What does it mean to return
                        to that God who gave us life? I had a call from someone who was
                        disturbed about that question. He said, "Now, does that mean all the
                        wicked will return back into the presence of God? How shall they be
                        worthy to stand in the presence of the Lord? Now, how could that be
                        possible?" Well, that started me on a bit of thinking, and then I found
                        the prophet Alma explaining to his son Corianton this same matter. You
                        will find in the fortieth chapter of Alma how Alma explained this
                        matter to his son Corianton. He said: "Now, concerning the state of the
                        soul between death and the resurrection--Behold, it has been made known
                        unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are
                        departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether
                        they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life"
                        (Alma 40:11). Now you note the difference? In one place it suggests
                        that we shall enter into the very presence of; In the next place it
                        says that we shall go home to <em>that</em> God who gave <em>us</em>
                        life.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In
                        discussing this matter I have found the quotation from President
                        Brigham Young contained in his <em>Discourses,</em> which says: "[The
                        scripture] reads that the spirit goes to God who gave it. Let me render
                        this scripture a little plainer; when the spirits leave their bodies
                        they are in the presence of our Father and God, they are prepared then
                        to see, hear and understand spiritual things. But where is the spirit
                        world?" He answers by saying this:</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"If we go
                        back to our mother country, the States, we there find the righteous,
                        and we there find the wicked; if we go to California, we there find the
                        righteous and the wicked, all dwelling together; and when we go beyond
                        this veil, and leave our bodies which were taken from mother earth, and
                        which must return, our spirits will pass beyond the veil; we go where
                        both Saints and sinners go; they all go to one place.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"If the
                        wicked wish to escape from his presence, they must go where he is not,
                        where he does not live, where his influence does not preside. To find
                        such a place is impossible, except they go beyond the bounds of time
                        and space." (<em>Discourses of Brigham Young,</em><big> </big>sel.

                        understand what President Young is saying, when we go home to God, it
                        is just like going back to our home country. We may not go into the
                        presence of the governor of the state where we live, but we will go to
                        the home country, and there we shall find our level among the people
                        with whom we are most accustomed to associate. <small>(<em>The

                            words of Alma as I understand them, do not intend to convey the thought
                            that all spirits go back into the presence of God for an assignment to
                            a place of peace or a place of punishment and before him receive their
                            individual sentence. "Taken home to God," (Compare Ecclesiastics 12:7.)
                            simply means that their mortal existence has come to an end, and they
                            have returned to the world of spirits, where they are assigned to a
                            place according to their works with the just or with the unjust, there
                            to await the resurrection. "Back to God" is a phrase which finds an
                            equivalent in many other well known conditions. For instance: a man
                            spends a stated time in some foreign mission field. When he is released
                            and returns to the United States, he may say, "It is wonderful to be
                            back home"; yet his home may be somewhere in Utah or Idaho or some
                            other part of the West. <small>(<em>Answers to Gospel Questions, </em></small></big></big><big>2:

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Alma, when
                        he says that "the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from

                        has the idea doubtless, in his mind that our God is omnipresent--not in
                        His own personality but through His minister, the Holy Spirit. He does
                        not intend to convey the idea that they are immediately ushered into
                        the personal presence of God. He evidently uses that phrase in a
                        qualified sense. . . . Solomon, makes such a similar statement: "Then
                        shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall
                        return unto God who gave it." The same idea is frequently expressed by
                        the Latter-day Saints. <small>(<em>Gospel Truths</em>, p. 73.)</small><br>
