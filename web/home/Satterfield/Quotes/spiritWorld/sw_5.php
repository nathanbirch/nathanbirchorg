                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>[From a
                        sermon given at the funeral of Jedediah M. Grant] I went to see him one
                        day last week, and he reached out his hand and shook hands with me; he
                        could not speak, but he shook hands warmly with me. I felt for him, and
                        wanted to raise him up, and to have him stay and help us whip the
                        devils and bring to pass righteousness. Why? Because he was valiant,
                        and I loved him. He was a great help to us, and you would be, if you
                        were as valiant as he was, which you can be through faithfulness and
                        obedience. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I laid my
                        hands upon him and blessed him, and asked God to strengthen his lungs
                        that he might be easier, and in two or three minutes he raised himself
                        up and talked for about an hour as busily as he could, telling me what
                        he had seen and what he understood, until I was afraid he would weary
                        himself, when I arose and left him. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>He said to
                        me, brother Heber, I have been into the spirit world two nights in
                        succession, and, of all the dreads that ever came across me, the worst
                        was to have to again return to my body, through I had to do it. But O,
                        says he, the order and government that were there! When in the spirit
                        world, I saw the order of righteous men and women; beheld them
                        organized in their several grades, and there appeared to be no
                        obstruction to my vision; I could see every man and woman in their
                        grade and order. I looked to see whether there was any disorder there,
                        but there was none; neither could I see any death nor any darkness,
                        disorder or confusion. He said that the people he there saw were
                        organized in family capacities; and when he looked at them he saw grade
                        after grade, and all were organized and in perfect harmony. He would
                        mention one item after another and say, "Why, it is just as brother
                        Brigham says it is; it is just as he has told us many a time." </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>That is a
                        testimony as to the truth of what brother Brigham teaches us, and I
                        know it is true, from what little light I have.</big></big><br
                    style="font-family: arial;" wp="BR2">
                </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>He saw the
                        righteous gathered together in the spirit world, and there were no
                        wicked spirits among them. He saw his wife; she was the first person
                        that came to him. He saw many that he knew, but did not have
                        conversation with any except his wife Caroline. She came to him, and he
                        said that she looked beautiful and had their little child, that died on
                        the Plains, in her arms, and said, "Mr. Grant, here is little Margaret;
                        you know that the wolves ate her up, but it did not hurt her; here she
                        is all right." </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"To my
                        astonishment," he said, "when I looked at families there was a
                        deficiency in some, there was a lack, for I saw families that would not
                        be permitted to come and dwell together, because they had not honored
                        their calling here." </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>He asked
                        his wife Caroline where Joseph and Hyrum and Father Smith and others
                        were; she replied, "they have gone away ahead, to perform and transact
                        business for us." The same as when brother Brigham and his brethren
                        left Winter Quarters and came here to search out a home; they came to
                        find a location for their brethren. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>He also
                        spoke of the buildings he saw there, remarking that the Lord gave
                        Solomon wisdom and poured gold and silver into his hands that he might
                        display his skill and ability, and said that the temple erected by
                        Solomon was much inferior to the most ordinary buildings he saw in the
                        spirit world. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In regard
                        to gardens, says brother Grant, "I have seen good gardens on this
                        earth, but I never saw any to compare with those that were there. I saw
                        flowers of numerous kinds, and some with from fifty to a hundred
                        different colored flowers growing upon one stalk." We have many kinds
                        of flowers on the earth, and I suppose those very articles came from
                        heaven, or they would not be here. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>After
                        mentioning the things that he had seen, he spoke of how much he
                        disliked to return and resume his body, after having seen the beauty
                        and glory of the spirit world, where the righteous spirits are gathered
                        together. Some may marvel at my speaking about these things, for many
                        profess to believe that we have no spiritual existence. But do you not
                        believe that my spirit was organized before it came to my body here?
                        And do you not think there can be houses and gardens, fruit trees, and
                        every other good thing there? The spirits of those things were made, as
                        well as our spirits, and it follows that they can exist upon the same
                        principle. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>After
                        speaking of the gardens and the beauty of every thing there, brother
                        Grant said that he felt extremely sorrowful at having to leave so
                        beautiful a place and come back to earth, for he looked upon his body
                        with loathing, but was obliged to enter it again. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>He said
                        that after he came back he could look upon his family and see the
                        spirit that was in them, and the darkness that was in them; and that he
                        conversed with them about the Gospel, and what they should do, and they
                        replied, "Well, brother Grant, perhaps it is so, and perhaps it is
                        not," and said that was the state of this people, to a great extent,
                        for many are full of darkness and will not believe me. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I never had
                        a view of the righteous assembling in the spirit-world, but I have had
                        a view of the hosts of hell, and have seen them as plainly as I see you
                        to-day. The righteous spirits gather together to prepare and qualify
                        themselves for a future day, and evil spirits have no power over them,
                        though they are constantly striving for the mastery. I have seen evil
                        spirits attempt to overcome those holding the Priesthood, and I know
                        how they act. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I feel
                        well, and I do not feel to condescend to a spirit of mourning. If I do
                        weep, I will weep for my own sins and not for Jedediah. If he could
                        speak he would say, "Weep not for me, but weep for your own sins." <small>(<em>Journal

                            This veil, a condition of our entire second estate, is associated with

                <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><big style="font-family: arial;"><big>We
                            do not now know precisely how God handles things in the spirit world so
                            that life there is an extension of walking by faith. Death does not
                            suddenly bestow upon the disbeliever full awareness of all reality,
                            thereby obviating the need for any faith. Instead, what follows death
                            is a continuum of the basic structure in mortality-until the Judgment
                            Day, when every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is
                            the Christ (see Romans 14:11; Philippians 2:10; D&amp;C 76:110). Until
                            then, we "walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Corinthians 5:7). How will
                            God ensure this condition in the spirit world? We do not know. Yet He
                            has certainly so handled the second estate in relation to the first
                            estate, hasn't He? The memories of the first estate are not accessible
                            in the second estate. The spirit world will be so arranged that there
                            will be no legitimate complaints later over the justice and mercy of
                            God (see Mosiah 27:31; Alma 12:15). Furthermore, the gospel, when
                            preached in the spirit world, will bring the same responses as here:
                            "some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not"
                            (Acts 28:24). <small>[<em>That Ye May Believe</em>. Salt Lake City:

                        advantage over those who have had to develop faith in mortality
                        concerning that prospect? If, for instance, the same attitudes with
                        which we die persist, then there will be no automatic or immediate
                        flip-flop into a totally different way of thinking. Such can occur
                        there, just as it does here, upon our accepting the gospel and
                        responding with both faith and repentance (Alma 34:34). Again, our
                        existence in the spirit world is part of the mortal sector of our
                        Father's plan which culminates with the Judgment and the Resurrection.

                        not suddenly bestow upon the disbeliever full awareness of all reality,
                        thereby obviating the need for any faith. Instead, what follows death
                        is a continuum of the basic structure in mortality-until the Judgment
                        Day, when every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is
                        the Christ (see Romans 14:11; Philippians 2:10; D&amp;C 76:110). Until
                        then, we "walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Corinthians 5:7). </big></big></p>

                        God ensure this condition in the spirit world? We do not know. Yet He
                        has certainly so handled the second estate in relation to the first
                        estate, hasn't He? The memories of the first estate are not accessible
                        in the second estate. The spirit world will be so arranged that there
                        will be no legitimate complaints later over the justice and mercy of
                        God (see Mosiah 27:31; Alma 12:15). </big></big></p>

                        brightness and glory of the next apartment is inexpressible. It is not
                        encumbered so that when we advance in years we have to be stubbing
                        along and be careful lest we fall down. We see our youth, even,
                        frequently stubbing their toes and falling down. But yonder, how
                        different! They move with ease and like lightning. If we want to visit
                        Jerusalem, or this, that, or the other place--and I presume we will be
                        permitted if we desire--there we are, looking at its streets. If we
                        want to behold Jerusalem as it was in the days of the Savior; or if we
                        want to see the Garden of Eden as it was when created, there we are,
                        and we see it as it existed spiritually, for it was created first
                        spiritually and then temporally, and spiritually it still remains. And
                        when there we may behold the earth as at the dawn of creation, or we
                        may visit any city we please that exists upon its surface. If we wish
                        to understand how they are living here on these western islands, or in
                        China, we are there; in fact, we are like the light of the morning, or,
                        I will not say the electric fluid but its operations on the wires. God
                        has revealed some little things, with regard to his movements and
                        power, and the operation and motion of the lightning furnish a fine
                        illustration of the ability of the Almighty. When we pass into the
                        spirit world we shall possess a measure of his power. Here, we are
                        continually troubled with ills and ailments of various kinds. In the
                        spirit world we are free from all this and enjoy life, glory, and
                        intelligence; and we have the Father to speak to us, Jesus to speak to
                        us, and angels to speak to us, and we shall enjoy the society of the
                        just and the pure who are in the spirit world until the resurrection. <small>(<em>Discourses

                        being which exist in the present world. For instance, Jesus Christ and
                        the thief on the cross, both went to the same place, and found

                        those who were bound; or, in other words, to preach the Gospel to the
                        spirits in prison, that they might be judged according to men in the

                        unprepared for resurrection, having need of remission of sins, and to

                        in this? Yes, they certainly can. Have you never read in the Book of
                        Mormon, where it informs us, that every act of our lives will be fresh
                        upon the memory, and we shall have a clear consciousness of all our
                        doings in this life? Yes; we have read that in the Book of Mormon--"a
                        clear consciousness."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>We read or
                        learn a thing by observation yesterday, and to-day or to-morrow it is
                        gone, unless it be something that impresses us distinctly, that makes a
                        vivid impression upon the mind, that we can remember it perhaps for
                        days, months, and years; but common information and knowledge are
                        constantly coming into our minds, and as constantly being forgotten.
                        And some of the knowledge we receive here at one time becomes so
                        completely obliterated, through the weakness of the animal system, that
                        we cannot call it to mind, no association of ideas will again suggest
                        it to our minds; it is gone, erased, eradicated from the tablet of our
                        memories. This is not owing to the want of capacity in the spirit; no,
                        but the spirit has a full capacity to remember; for do you suppose that
                        God in begetting spirits in the eternal world would beget an imperfect
                        thing, that had no capacities? No. The Being, who is full of
                        intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom, and acting upon the great
                        principles that are ordained for the generation of living beings,
                        spiritual beings, brings them forth with capacities capable of being
                        enlarged or extended wider and wider; consequently it is not the want
                        of capacity in the spirit of man that causes him to forget the
                        knowledge he may have learned yesterday; but it is because of the
                        imperfection of the tabernacle in which the spirit dwells; because
                        there is imperfection in the organization of the flesh and bones, and
                        in things pertaining to the tabernacle; it is this that erases from our
                        memory many things that would be useful; we cannot retain them in our
                        minds, they are gone into oblivion. It is not so with the spirit when
                        it is released from this tabernacle. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>. . . Wait
                        until these mortal bodies are laid in the tomb; when we return home to
                        God who gave us life; then is the time we shall have the most vivid
                        knowledge of all the past acts of our lives during our probationary
                        state; then is the time that we will find that this being we call
                        man--this spirit that dwells within the tabernacle, is a being that has
                        capacity sufficient to retain all its past doings, whether they be good
                        or bad.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>It is,
                        then, this memory that will produce the suffering and the pains upon
                        that class of spirits whose works have been wicked and abominable in
                        the sight of God. A spirit, then, will remember, that "at such a time
                        in yonder world, and at such a place, I disobeyed the commandments of
                        God; I did not hearken to the counsel of those whom God had appointed
                        to be my counsellors; I did not give heed to the man of God; no: but I
                        rejected his sayings; good counsel was imparted to me, but I did not
                        heed it." In this life, things that may have been erased from your
                        memory for years will be presented before you with all the vividness as
                        if they had just taken place. This will be like a worm upon the
                        conscience; it will prey upon the spirit, and produce unhappiness,
                        wretchedness, and misery. This will cause you to lament, and mourn, and
                        weep after you are cast out from the presence of God--from the home to
                        which you have returned. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I am
                        speaking now of the wicked. What is it that produces the opposite
                        principle? There is an opposition in all things; it is the reflection
                        of the memory that produces joy; that is one of the elements by which
                        joy and happiness are produced upon the spirit of man in the future
                        state; we remember the acts of our past lives that they have been good;
                        we perceive by our memories that we have been obedient to counsel; we
                        perceive that when we have erred through our weakness we have repented
                        of that error; when we have been told of a fault we have forsaken it.
                        When we look back upon acquaintances and neighbors we perceive that we
                        have observed the golden rule, to do unto others as we would that
                        others should do unto us. We look back upon our past lives, and we
                        perceive we have never spoken evil against a brother or sister, that we
                        have never striven to stir up family broils, and that we have never
                        desired to injure any of the children of men, male or female. What do
                        these reflections produce? They produce joy, satisfaction, peace,
                        consolation, and this joy is a hundred fold more intense that what the
                        spirit is capable of perceiving or enjoying in this life. Why? Because
                        just in proportion to the vividness of the conscience, or the memory,
                        so will be the joy. This you may have knowledge of by every-day
                        experience; just in proportion to the vividness of your ideas, and of
                        the truth set before your minds, and or the good things that are
                        imparted to you, the more intense is your happiness here; how much more
                        intense would it be hereafter, when this mortal clog with all its
                        imperfections has been laid down in the gravel. The fact is, our
                        spirits then will be happy, far more happy than what we are capable
                        even of conceiving, or having the least idea of in this world. <small>(<em>Journal

                        bestowed it upon the children of men. His power is around them and
                        defends them; and when they pass into the spirit world they are out of

                        over us. If you are faithful to the truth, if you keep the commandments
                        of God all your days, when the time comes for you to pass away from
                        this state of existence, Satan's power will have ended. After that he
                        can exercise no dominion over you. You are emancipated from his
                        thraldom. You will then be ushered into the presence of the holy and
                        the just. You will dwell in the paradise of God, waiting with
                        delightful anticipations the time when your spirits and your bodies
                        will be reunited, and when you shall dwell together with the holy, the
                        just and exalted ones in the presence of God and the Lamb, nevermore,
                        as the prophets have said, to depart or to go out thence. <small>(<em>Collected

                                the enemy here, consequently when they leave this world they have
                                perfect control over those evil spirits, and they cannot be buffeted by
                                Satan. But as long as they live in the flesh no being on this earth, of

                                to the earth and your spirit is freed from this home of clay, has the
                                devil any power over it? Not one particle. This is an advantage which
                                the faithful will gain; but while they live on earth they are subject
                                to the buffetings of Satan. (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 3:371)</big></big><span

                        of the ancient Gadiantons are around us. You may see battle-field after
                        battle-field, scattered over this American continent, where the wicked
                        have slain the wicked. Their spirits are watching us continually for an
                        opportunity to influence us to do evil, or to make us decline in the
                        performance of our duties. And I will defy any man on earth to be more
                        gentlemanly and bland in his manners than the master spirit of all
                        evil. We call him the devil; a gentleman so smooth and so oily, that he
                        can almost deceive the very elect. We have been baptized by men having
                        the authority of the holy Priesthood of the Son of God, and
                        consequently we have power over him which the rest of the world do not
                        possess, and all who possess the power of the Priesthood have the power
                        and right to rebuke those evil powers, and they obey not, it is because
                        we do not live so as to have the power with God, which it is our
                        privilege to have. If we do not live for this privilege and right we
                        are under condemnation. <small>(<em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 12:128)</small><br

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>It is
                        written, "resist the devil and he will flee from you." Some people do
                        not believe that there are any devils. There are thousands of evil
                        spirits that are just as ugly as evil can make them. The wicked die,
                        and their spirits remain not far from where their tabernacles are. When
                        I was in England, twenty-eight years ago next June, I saw more devils
                        than there are persons here to-day; they came upon me with an intention
                        to destroy me; they are the spirits of wicked men who, while in the
                        flesh, were opposed to God and his purposes. I saw them with what we
                        call the spiritual eyes, but what is in reality the natural eye. The
                        atmosphere of many parts of these mountains is doubtless the abode of
                        the spirits of Gadianton robbers, whose spirits are as wicked as hell,
                        and who would kill Jesus Christ and every Apostle and righteous person
                        that ever lived if they had the power. It is by the influence of such
                        wicked spirits that men and women are all the time tempted to tell
                        little lies, to steal a little, to take advantage of their neighbor a
                        little, and they tell us there is no harm in it. It is by the influence
                        and power of evil spirits that the minds of men are prejudiced against
                        each other, until they are led to do each other an injury, and
                        sometimes to kill each other. <small>(<em>Journal of Discourses</em>,
