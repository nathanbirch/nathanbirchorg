                            is on this earth that was organized for the people that have lived and
                            that do and will live upon it. No other people can have it, and we can
                            have no other kingdom until we are prepared to inhabit this eternally. <small>(<em>Journal

                            anywhere nigh there but into the spirit world. Where is the spirit
                            world? It is right here. Do the good and evil spirits go together? Yes,
                            they do. Do they both inhabit one kingdom? Yes, they do. Do they go to
                            the sun? No. Do they go beyond the boundaries of the organized earth?
                            No, they do not. They are brought forth upon this earth, for the
                            express purpose of inhabiting it to all eternity. Where else are you
                            going? Nowhere else, only as you may be permitted. <small>(<em>Journal

                    <li><big><big>Here the inquiry will naturally arise, when our spirits
                            leave our bodies where do they go to? I will tell you. Will I locate
                            them? Yes, if you wish me to. They do not pass out of the organization
                            of this earth on which we live. You read in the Bible that when the
                            spirit leaves the body it goes to God who gave it. . . . It reads that
                            the spirit goes to God who gave it. Let me render this Scripture a
                            little plainer; when the spirits leave their bodies they are in the
                            presence of our Father and God, they are prepared then to see, hear and
                            understand spiritual things. But where is the spirit world? It is
                            incorporated within this celestial system. Can you see it with your
                            natural eyes? No. Can you see spirits in this room? No. Suppose the
                            Lord should touch your eyes that you might see, could you then see the
                            spirits? Yes, as plainly as you now see bodies, as did the servant of
                            Elijah. If the Lord would permit it, and it was His will that it should
                            be done, you could see the spirits that have departed from this world,
                            as plainly as you now see bodies with your natural eyes. <small>(<em>Journal

                        [the spirit world] location, it is here on the very planet where we
                        were born; or, in other words, the earth and other planets of a like
                        sphere, have their inward or spiritual spheres, as well as their
                        outward, or temporal. The one is peopled by temporal tabernacles, and
                        the other by spirits. A vail is drawn between the one sphere and the
                        other, whereby all the objects in the spiritual sphere are rendered
                        invisible to those in the temporal. <small>(<em>Key to the Science of

                            is the spirit world? Is it away up in the heavens? That isn't what the
                            scriptures and our brethren explain. They have told us the spirit world
                            is right here round about us, and the only spirits who can live here
                            are those who are assigned to fill their missions here on earth. This
                            is the spirit world. And if our eyes could be opened we could see those
                            who have departed from us--a father, mother, brother, a sister, a
                            child. We could see them, and sometimes when our physical senses are
                            asleep, sometimes our spiritual self--and we have ears, spiritual ears,
                            and spiritual eyes--sometimes they will be very keen and awake, and a
                            departed one may come while we are lying asleep and come into our
                            consciousness. We'll feel an impression. We'll wake up. Where does it
                            come from? It comes from the spirits of those whom we are sealed to. <small>(<em>The
