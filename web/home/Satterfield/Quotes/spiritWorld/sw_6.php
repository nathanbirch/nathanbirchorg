                            of Benjamin F. Johnson</em><strong>:</strong> Then with a deep-drawn
                        breath, as a sigh of weariness, he sank down heavily in his chair, and
                        said, "Oh! I am so tired--so tired that I often feel to long for my day
                        of rest. For what has there been in this life but tribulation for me?
                        From a boy I have been persecuted by my enemies, and now even my
                        friends are beginning to join with them, to hate and persecute me! Why
                        should I not wish for my time of rest?"</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>His words
                        and tone thrilled and shocked me, and like an arrow pierced my hopes
                        that he would long remain with us. I said, as with a heart full of
                        tears, "Oh! Joseph, what could we, as a people, do without you and what
                        would become of the great latter-day work if you should leave us?"</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>He was
                        touched by my emotions, and in reply he said, "Benjamin, I would not be
                        far away from you, and if on the other side of the veil I would still
                        be working with you, and with a power greatly increased, to roll on
                        this kingdom." <small>(<em>The Teachings of Joseph Smith</em></small> <small>[Larry

                        anxieties of the passing of this day shall have gone, in the quiet
                        loneliness of your home, in a day not too intense because of the

                        the spirit world? Is it away up in the heavens? That isn't what the
                        scriptures and our brethren explain. They have told us the spirit world
                        is right here round about us, and the only spirits who can live here
                        are those who are assigned to fill their missions here on earth. This
                        is the spirit world. And if our eyes could be opened we could see those
                        who have departed from us--a father, mother, brother, a sister, a
                        child. We could see them, and sometimes when our physical senses are
                        asleep, sometimes our spiritual self--and we have ears, spiritual ears,
                        and spiritual eyes--sometimes they will be very keen and awake, and a
                        departed one may come while we are lying asleep and come into our
                        consciousness. We'll feel an impression. We'll wake up. Where does it
                        come from? It comes from the spirits of those whom we are sealed to. <small>(<em>The

                            priesthood on the other side. I am sure of that. We have evidence of

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Sometimes
                        the Lord expands our vision from this point of view and this side of
                        the veil, that we feel and seem to realize that we can look beyond the
                        thin veil which separates us from that other sphere. If we can see, by
                        the enlightening influence of the Spirit of God and through the words
                        that have been spoken by the holy prophets of God, beyond the veil that
                        separates us from the spirit world, surely those who have passed
                        beyond, can see more clearly through the veil back here to us than it
                        is possible for us to see to them from our sphere of action. I believe
                        we move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and
                        of heavenly beings. We are not separated from them. We begin to realize
                        more and more fully, as we become acquainted with the principles of the
                        gospel, as they have been revealed anew in this dispensation, that we
                        are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors, to our friends
                        and associates and co-laborers who have preceded us into the spirit
                        world. We cannot forget them; we do not cease to love them; we always
                        hold them in our hearts, in memory, and thus we are associated and
                        united to them by ties that we cannot break, that we cannot dissolve or
                        free ourselves from. If this is the case with us in our finite
                        condition, surrounded by our mortal weaknesses, shortsightedness, lack
                        of inspiration and wisdom, from time to time, how much more certain it
                        is, and reasonable and consistent, to believe that those who have been
                        faithful, who have gone beyond, are still engaged in the work for the
                        salvation of the souls of men, in the opening of the prison doors to
                        them that are bound and proclaiming liberty to the captives, who can
                        see us better than we can see them -- that they know us better than we
                        know them. They have advanced; we are advancing; we are growing as they
                        have grown; we are reaching the goal that they have attained unto; and
                        therefore, I claim that we live in their presence, they see us, they
                        are solicitous for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. For
                        now they see the dangers that beset us; they can comprehend better than
                        ever before, the weaknesses that are liable to mislead us into dark and
                        forbidden paths. They see the temptations and the evils that beset us
                        in life, and the proneness of mortal beings to yield to temptation and
                        to wrong doing; hence their solicitude for us and their love for us and
                        their desire for our well being must be greater than that which we feel
                        for ourselves. <small>(<em>Gospel Doctrine</em>, p.430)</small><br>
