                            world? It is right here. Do the good and evil spirits go together? Yes,
                            they do. Do they both inhabit one kingdom? Yes, they do. Do they go to
                            the sun? No. Do they go beyond the boundaries of this organized earth?
                            No, they do not. They are brought forth upon this earth, for the
                            express purpose of inhabiting it to all eternity. Where else are you

                            mortality, or they cannot put on immortality. This body must be

                            of the purposes of man's mortal probation is to pass through the
                            experience we call death. This experience is necessary "to fulfill the
                            merciful plan of the great Creator" (2 Nephi 9:6). In death, the body
                            returns to the earth or the elements from which it was created, and the
                            spirit goes into the world of spirits -- there to wait the day of
                            resurrection. <small>(<em>Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson</em>, p.30)<br>

                    <li><big><big>That there is a Spirit World, and that it is closely
                            connected with the material world--the one we now inhabit--has been a
                            tenet in the religious philosophy of wise and good men all down the
                            ages. In the minds of many people, the Spirit World and Heaven are
                            synonymous terms, indicating one and the same place. But in reality
                            there is a wide difference between them. A State of rest, such as the
                            spirit life is understood to be for the righteous--though "rest" should
                            not be interpreted as idleness or want of occupation--might easily pass
                            for heaven, when contrasted with this life of pain, sorrow and trouble.
                            But that is only relative. It is not saying too much--indeed it may be
                            saying too little--to affirm that there is just as much difference
                            between the spirit world and heaven, as between the mortal and the
                            spiritual phases of man's existence. <small>(<em>Cowley &amp; Whitney
