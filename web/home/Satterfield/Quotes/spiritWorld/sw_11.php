                        soul, look at the unbelieving world, that is a great many of them, they
                        now believe in spiritual knockings, spiritual communications, and
                        spiritual rappings, and they will ask the same spirit for this, and for
                        that; to know this, that, and the other; and, "Won't you cause that
                        table to kick up its legs, and that chair to dance, and cause a
                        knocking here, and a knocking there?" They believe all this, still they
                        do not believe that God can communicate. And at the same time those
                        that they communicate with are corrupt spirits, and they might know it,
                        and still they say they can speak from the heavens, and communicate
                        this, that, and the other, and tell them where their friends are. If
                        wicked spirits can do this, I want to know, on the same principle, if
                        the righteous have not power to communicate to the children of men? And
                        has not God power to do it?<small> (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>,

                        communicated with Jesus and his disciples on the holy mount? Moses and

                        commission to preach the Gospel to every creature in all the world? He
                        that had passed the vale of death, and had dwelt in the spirit world,
                        yea, he that had ascended far on high above the realms of death, and

                        liveth and was dead, through his angel, who declared to John--Behold, I
                        am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, that have the

                        ancient dead? Moroni, who had lived upon the earth fourteen hundred
                        years before. Who ordained Joseph the Prophet, and his fellow-servant,
                        to the preparatory Priesthood, to baptize for remission of sins? John
                        the Baptist, who had been beheaded! Who ordained our first founders to
