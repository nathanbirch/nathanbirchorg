                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I know a
                        father who lost his daughter, a mother of four or five children, and it
                        was a long fight. I have never seen a father or mother who had greater
                        devotion to a daughter, and as she sank into the shadows the father
                        said, "I guess I failed. If I had faith, she would have gotten well."
                        The Lord said that "those who have faith in me shall be healed if they
                        are not appointed unto death" (see D&amp;C 42:48). That suggests that
                        we are here filling a mission on earth. We can fail in our appointment,
                        but if we live true, then we fulfill our mission. Now, if the Lord asks
                        us, calls us to no greater calling, I ask you, Would any one of you
                        want to remain here one hour more than the Lord wants you to live in
                        mortality, if He had something else for you to do? Not if you are
                        thinking right. You would want to answer the call of the Master,
                        wouldn't you? <small>(<em>The Teachings of Harold B. Lee</em>, p. 48)</small><br>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>On one
                        occasion he was suddenly taken very sick -- near to death's door. While
                        he lay in this condition, President Peter Maughan, who was dead, came
                        to him and said: "Brother Roskelley, we held a council on the other
                        side of the veil. I have had a great deal to do, and I have the
                        privilege of coming here to appoint one man to come and help. I have
                        had three names given to me in council, and you are one of them. I want
                        to inquire into your circumstances.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The Bishop
                        told him what he had to do, and they conversed together as one man
                        would converse with another. President Maughan then said to him: "I
                        think I will not call you. I think you are wanted here more than
                        perhaps one of the others."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Bishop
                        Roskelley got well from that hour. Very soon after, the second man was
                        taken sick, but not being able to exercise sufficient faith, Brother
                        Roskelley did not go to him. By and by this man recovered, and on
                        meeting Brother Roskelley, he said: "brother Maughan came to me the
                        other night and told me he was sent to call one man from the ward," and
                        he named two men as had been done to Brother Roskelley. A few days
                        afterwards the third man was taken sick and died.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Now, I name
                        this to show a principle. They have work on the other side of the veil;
                        and they want men, and they call them. And that was my view in regards
                        to Brother George A. Smith. When he was almost at death's door, Brother
                        Cannon administered to him, and in thirty minutes he was up and ate
                        breakfast with his family. We labored with him in this way, but
                        ultimately, as you know, he died. But it taught me a lesson. I felt
                        that man was wanted behind the veil. We labored also with Brother
                        Pratt; but he, too, was wanted behind the veil. <small>(<em>The
                                Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</em>, pp.290-291)</small></big></big><small>

                            lost one of our apostles a short time since. He was about the youngest
                            man in the quorum of the apostles. He was suddenly called away from us.
                            There is a meaning to this. Many times things take place with us that
                            we do not comprehend, unless it is given to us by revelation. But there
                            is a meaning in the loss of that young apostle. I had a manifestation
                            of that while in San Francisco recently. </big></big><br

                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big>One evening, as I fell asleep, I
                            was very much troubled with evil spirits that tried to afflict me; and
                            while laboring to throw off these spirits and their influence, there
                            was another spirit visited me that seemed to have power over the evil
                            spirits, and they departed from me. Before he left me he told me not to
                            grieve because of the departure of Abraham Hoagland Cannon; for the
                            Lord had called him to fill another important mission in the spirit
                            world, as a pure and holy apostle from Zion in the Rocky Mountains -- a
                            labor which would not only prove a great benefit to his father's
                            household, but to the Church and kingdom of God on the earth. I feel to
                            name this, because it is true. I have become acquainted with many
                            things in our history that I have marveled at. While in the St. George
                            temple I had a son, who was in the north country, drowned. He had a
                            warning of this. In a dream he was notified how he would die. We had
                            testimony of that after his death. I asked the Lord why he was taken
                            from me. The answer to me was, "You are doing a great deal for the
                            redemption of your dead; but the law of redemption requires some of
                            your own seed in the spirit world to attend to work connected with
                            this." That was a new principle to me; but it satisfied me why he was
                            taken away. I name this, because there are a great many instances like
                            it among the Latter-day Saints. This was the case with Brother Abraham
                            Cannon. He was taken away to fulfil that mission. And where we have
                            anything of this kind, we should leave it in the hands of God to
                            reconcile. <small>(<em>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</em>, p.292)</small></big></big><small><span

                        need the same gospel, and releases occur here to aid the Lord's work
                        there. Each release of a righteous individual from this life is also a
                        call to new labors. Those who have true hope understand this.</big></big></p>

                        gracefully forgoing the extended association with choice individuals
                        here, in order that they could help hundreds there. In God's ecology,
                        talent and love are never wasted. The hopeful understand this, too.<small>
