                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I believe
                        the eyes of the heavenly hosts are over this people; I believe they are
                        watching the elders of Israel, the prophets and apostles and men who
                        are called to bear off this kingdom. I believe they watch over us all
                        with great interest&#8230;. I have had many interviews with Brother Joseph
                        until the last fifteen or twenty years of my life; I have not seen him
                        for that length of time. But during my travels in the southern country
                        last winter I had many interviews with President Young, and with Heber
                        C. Kimball, and George A. Smith, and Jedediah M. Grant, and many others
                        who are dead. They attended our conference, they attended our meetings.
                        And on one occasion, I saw Brother Brigham and Brother Heber ride in
                        carriage ahead of the carriage in which I rode when I was on my way to
                        attend conference; and they were dressed in the most priestly robes.
                        When we arrived at our destination I asked President Young if he would
                        preach to us. He said, "No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh.
                        I shall not talk to this people any more." "But, said he, "I have come
                        to see you; I have come to watch over you, and to see what the people
                        are doing." Then, said he, "I want you to teach the people--and I want
                        you to follow this counsel yourself--that they must labor and so live
                        as to obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the
                        kingdom; without the spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the
                        dark, and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles
                        and as elders in the church and kingdom of God." And, said he, "Brother
                        Joseph taught me this principle."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>And I will
                        here say, I have heard him refer to that while he was living. But what
                        I was going to say is this: the thought came to me that Brother Joseph
                        had left the work of watching over this Church and kingdom to others,
                        and that he had gone ahead, and that he had left this work to men who
                        have lived and labored with us since he left us. This idea manifested
                        itself to me, that such men advance in the spirit world. And I believe
                        myself that these men who have died and gone into the spirit world had
                        this mission left with them; that is, a certain portion of them, to
                        watch over the Latter-day Saints. <small>(<em>The Discourses of
                                Wilford Woodruff</em>, p.290)</small><br>

                    </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big><strong>Joseph F. Smith</strong></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I feel sure
                        that the Prophet Joseph Smith and his associates, who, under the
                        guidance and inspiration of the Almighty, and by His power, began this
                        latter-day work, would rejoice and do rejoice.--I was going to say if
                        they were permitted to look down upon the scene that I behold in this
                        tabernacle, but I believe they do have the privilege of looking down
                        upon us just as the all-seeing eye of God beholds every part of His
                        handiwork. For I believe that those who have been chosen in this
                        dispensation and in former dispensations, to lay the foundation of
                        God's work in the midst of the children of men, for their salvation and
                        exaltation, will not be deprived in the spirit world from looking down
                        upon the results of their own labors, efforts and mission assigned them
                        by the wisdom and purpose of God, to help to redeem and to reclaim the
                        children of the Father from their sins. So I feel quite confident that
                        the eye of Joseph, the Prophet, and of the martyrs of this
                        dispensation, and of Brigham and John and Wilford, and those faithful
                        men who were associated with them in their ministry upon the earth, are
                        carefully guarding the interests of the Kingdom of God in which they
                        labored and for which they strove during their mortal lives. I believe
                        they are as deeply interested in our welfare today, if not with greater
                        capacity, with far more interest behind the veil, than they were in the
                        flesh. I believe they know more; I believe their minds have expanded
                        beyond their comprehension in mortal life, and their interests are
                        enlarged and expanded in the work of the Lord to which they gave their
                        lives and their best service. Although some may feel and think that it
                        is a little extreme to take this view, yet I believe that it is true;
                        and I have a feeling in my heart that I stand in the presence not only
                        of the Father and of the Son, but in the presence of those whom God
                        commissioned, raised up and inspired to lay the foundations of the work
                        in which we are engaged. Accompanying that sense or feeling, I am
                        impressed with the thought that I would not this moment say or do one
                        thing that would be taken as unwise or imprudent, or that would give
                        offense to any of my former associates and co-laborers in the work of
                        the Lord.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I would not
                        like to say one thing, or express a thought that would grieve the heart
                        of Joseph, or of Brigham, or of John, or of Wilford, or Lorenzo, or any
                        of their faithful associates in the ministry. Sometimes the Lord
                        expands our vision from this point of view and this side of the veil,
                        that we feel and seem to realize that we can look beyond the thin veil
                        which separates us from that other sphere. If we can see by the
                        enlightening influence of the Spirit of God and through the words that
                        have been spoken by the holy prophets of God, beyond the veil that
                        separates us from the spirit world, surely those who have passed
                        beyond, can see more clearly through the veil back here to us than it
                        is possible for us to see to them from our sphere of action. I believe
                        we move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and
                        of heavenly beings. We are not separate from them. We begin to realize
                        more and more fully, as we become acquainted with the principles of the
                        Gospel, as they have been revealed anew in this dispensation, that we
                        are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors, to our friends
                        and associates and co-laborers who have preceded us into the spirit
                        world. We cannot forget them; we do not cease to love them; we always
                        hold them in our hearts, in memory, and thus we are associated and
                        united to them by ties that we can not break, that we can not dissolve
                        or free ourselves from. If this is the case with us in our finite
                        condition, surrounded by our mortal weaknesses, shortsightedness, lack
                        of inspiration and wisdom from time to time, how much more certain it
                        is and reasonable and consistent to believe that those who have been
                        faithful, who have gone beyond and are still engaged in the work for
                        the salvation of the souls of men, the opening of the prison doors to
                        them that are bound and proclaiming liberty to the captives who can see
                        us better than we can see them; that they know us better than we know
                        them. They have advanced; we are advancing; we are growing as they have
                        grown; we are reaching the goal that they have attained unto; and
                        therefore, I claim that we live in their presence, they see us, they
                        are solicitous for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. For
                        now they see the dangers that beset us; they can comprehend better than
                        ever before, the weaknesses that are liable to mislead us into dark and
                        forbidden paths. They see the temptations and the evils that beset us
                        in life and the proneness ofmortal beings to yield to temptation and to
                        wrong doing; hence their solicitude for us and their love for us and
                        their desire for our well being must be greater than that which we feel
                        for ourselves. I thank God for the feeling that I possess and enjoy and
                        for the realization that I have, that I stand, not only in the presence
                        of Almighty God, my Maker and Father, but in the presence of His Only
                        Begotten Son in the flesh, the Savior of the world; and I stand in the
                        presence of Peter and James, (and perhaps the eyes of John are also
                        upon us and we know it not); and that I stand also in the presence of
                        Joseph and Hyrum and Brigham and John, and those who have been valiant
                        in the testimony of Jesus Christ and faithful to their mission in the
                        world, who have gone before. When I go I want to have the privilege of
                        meeting them with the consciousness that I have followed their example,
                        that I have carried out the mission in which they were engaged as they
                        would have it carried out; that I have been as faithful in the
                        discharge of duty committed to me and required at my hand as they were
                        faithful in their time, and that when I meet them I shall meet them as
                        I met them here, in love, in harmony, in unison and in perfect
                        confidence that I have done my duty as they have done theirs.<small>

                        along alone, I seemed to see a council in heaven. The Savior was there;
                        the Prophet Joseph was there; my father and others that I knew were
                        there. In this council it seemed that they decided that a mistake had
                        been made in not filling the vacancies in the Quorum of the Twelve, and
                        conference had adjourned. The chances were the Brethren would wait
                        another six months, and the way to remedy the situation was to send a
                        revelation naming the men who should fill the vacancies. <small>(Conference
