                <P>Another of the purposes of man's mortal probation is to pass through the experience we call death. This experience is necessary "to fulfill the merciful plan of
                    the great Creator" (2 Nephi 9:6). In death, the body returns to the earth or the elements from which it was created, and the spirit goes into the world of spirits --
                    there to wait the day of resurrection.  (<EM>Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson</EM>, p.30)</P>

                    <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That there is a Spirit World, and that it is closely connected with the material world--the one we now inhabit--has been a tenet in the religious philosophy of wise and
                        good men all down the ages. In the minds of many people, the Spirit World and Heaven are synonymous terms, indicating one and the same place. But in reality there is a
                        wide difference between them. A State of rest, such as the spirit life is understood to be for the righteous--though "rest" should not be interpreted as idleness or want of
                        occupation--might easily pass for heaven, when contrasted with this life of pain, sorrow and trouble. But that is only relative. It is not saying too much--indeed it may be
                        saying too little--to affirm that there is just as much difference between the spirit world and heaven, as between the mortal and the spiritual phases of man's existence.

                <P>Since those who go to the celestial kingdom include, as revealed, those who "overcome by faith" (D&amp;C 76:53), the same efforts and triumph would need to

                        of our Father and God, they are prepared then to see, hear and understand spiritual things.  But where is the spirit world?  It is incorporated within this
                        celestial system.  Can you see it with your natural eyes?  No.  Can you see spirits in this room?  No.  Suppose the Lord should touch your eyes that you might
                        see, could you then see the spirits?  Yes, as plainly as you now see bodies, as did the servant of Elijah.  If the Lord would permit it, and it was His will that it
                        should be done, you could see the spirits that have departed from this world, as plainly as you now see bodies with your natural eyes. (<EM>Journal of Discourses</EM>,

                <P>Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection--Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as
                    soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</P>

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it" (Ecclesiastes 12:7). What does it mean to return to that God
                    who gave us life? I had a call from someone who was disturbed about that question. He said, "Now, does that mean all the wicked will return back into the
                    presence of God? How shall they be worthy to stand in the presence of the Lord? Now, how could that be possible?" Well, that started me on a bit of thinking,
                    and then I found the prophet Alma explaining to his son Corianton this same matter. You will find in the fortieth chapter of Alma how Alma explained this
                    matter to his son Corianton. He said: "Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection--Behold, it has been made known unto me by
                    an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home
                    to that God who gave them life" (Alma 40:11). Now you note the difference? In one place it suggests that we shall enter into the very presence of; In the next
                    place it says that we shall go home to <EM>that</EM> God who gave <EM>us</EM> life.</FONT></P>

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In discussing this matter I have found the quotation from President Brigham Young contained in his <EM>Discourses,</EM> which says: "[The scripture] reads that the
                    spirit goes to God who gave it. Let me render this scripture a little plainer; when the spirits leave their bodies they are in the presence of our Father and God,
                    they are prepared then to see, hear and understand spiritual things. But where is the spirit world?" He answers by saying this:</FONT></P>

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">"If we go back to our mother country, the States, we there find the righteous, and we there find the wicked; if we go to California, we there find the righteous
                    and the wicked, all dwelling together; and when we go beyond this veil, and leave our bodies which were taken from mother earth, and which must return, our
                    spirits will pass beyond the veil; we go where both Saints and sinners go; they all go to one place.</FONT></P>

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">"If the wicked wish to escape from his presence, they must go where he is not, where he does not live, where his influence does not preside. To find such a
                    place is impossible, except they go beyond the bounds of time and space." (<EM>Discourses of Brigham Young,</EM> sel. John A. Widtsoe [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As I understand what President Young is saying, when we go home to God, it is just like going back to our home country. We may not go into the presence of
                    the governor of the state where we live, but we will go to the home country, and there we shall find our level among the people with whom we are most
                    accustomed to associate. (<EM>The Teachings of Harold B. Lee</EM>, pp. 57-58)</FONT></P>

                <P>These words of Alma as I understand them, do not intend to convey the thought that all spirits go back into the presence of God for an assignment to a place of
                    peace or a place of punishment and before him receive their individual sentence. "Taken home to God," (Compare Ecclesiastics 12:7.) simply means that their
                    mortal existence has come to an end, and they have returned to the world of spirits, where they are assigned to a place according to their works with the just or
                    with the unjust, there to await the resurrection. "Back to God" is a phrase which finds an equivalent in many other well known conditions. For instance: a man
                    spends a stated time in some foreign mission field. When he is released and returns to the United States, he may say, "It is wonderful to be back home"; yet his
                    home may be somewhere in Utah or Idaho or some other part of the West. (<EM>Answers to Gospel Questions,</EM> 2: 84)</P>

                    idea that they are immediately ushered into the personal presence of God. He evidently uses that phrase in a qualified sense. . . . Solomon, makes such a similar
                    statement: "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." The same idea is frequently expressed by the

                <P>The spirits of all men, as soon as they depart from this mortal body, whether they are good or evil, we are told in the Book of Mormon, are taken home to that
                    God who gave them life, where there is a separation, a partial judgment, and the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness which is
                    called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they expand in wisdom, where they have respite from all their troubles, and where care and sorrow do not
                    annoy. The wicked, on the contrary, have no part nor portion in the Spirit of the Lord, and they are cast into outer darkness, being led captive, because of their
                    own iniquity, by the evil one. And in this space between death and the resurrection of the body, the two classes of souls remain, in happiness or in misery, until
                    the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth and be reunited both spirit and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged
                    according to their works. This is the final judgment. (<EM>Gospel Doctrine</EM>, p. 448)</P>

                    of happiness, peace, and restful work. The spirits of the wicked (the unjust) had gone to prison, a state of darkness and misery. (See Alma 40: 12-15.) Jesus

                <P>To begin with, a certain peacefulness and restfulness will occur in paradise, because the faithful will see things with a more complete, restful, and reassuring

                    So many of the cares and demands of the of the world which press upon us here and now, including doing the chores of this world, will not dominate us there. 
                    Hence, paradise will be, comparatively, "a state of peace."  Furthermore, the spirit body will not suffer certain of the ills and constraints which now beset the
                    mortal body.  The result will be added sextfulness there, as described by Elder John Taylor: "[Death] this dark shadow and valley is so trifling . . . [one is]
                    passed from a state of sorrow [and] grief, . . . into a state of existence where I can enjoy life to the fullest extent as far as that can be done without a body. . . . I

                <P>There is an expression that the Lord made to Enoch in regard to those who should be destroyed in the flood, in the days of Noah.</P>

                <P>He said he had prepared a prison for them, because of their disobedience, and would shut them in it. There they would remain until the time when they should
                    be visited by the Son of God, when he should again carry to them that message which they rejected from Noah.</P>

                <P>We read in the scriptures that the Son of God, after his death, went to the spirits in prison and taught them the principles of the gospel, that they might live
                    according to God in the spirit and be judged according to men in the flesh. Those very same spirits, who were disobedient in the days of Noah, heard the voice
                    of the Son of God when he went to them, while his body was in the tomb, and all who were willing to receive his testimony and obey his commandments
                    received relief from their torment.</P>

                <P>But from the time of their death in the flood until the time of the crucifixion of the Savior, they were shut up in the prison house in torment, suffering the
                    penalty of their transgressions, because they refused to hear a prophet of the Lord - and so it will be with every man who rejects the gospel, whether he lived

                    <LI>We hear the objection made, from time to time, that Jesus did not come to save the dead, for he most emphatically declared himself that there was an
                        impassable gulf that separated the righteous spirits from the wicked. In defense of their position they quote the words in Luke: "And beside all this, between
                        us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."</LI>
                </UL>

                <P>These words, according to the story, were spoken by Abraham's spirit to the rich man who raised his eyes and asked that Lazarus might go touch his lips and
                    relieve his torment. Abraham replied that it could not be for there was a gulf fixed between them that the spirit of no man could pass. Therefore, say the
                    objectors to the doctrine of universal salvation, "It is quite evident that the righteous and the wicked who are dead cannot visit each other, hence there is no
                    salvation for the dead."</P>

                <P>This was true before the days that Jesus atoned for sin, which is plainly shown in the passage from the Book of Moses previously quoted. And it was at this
                    period this event occurred. However, Christ came and through his death bridged that gulf, proclaimed liberty to the captives, and the opening of this prison door
                    to those who sat in darkness and captivity.</P>

                <P><EM>From that time forth this gulf is bridged so that the captives, after they have paid the full penalty of their misdeeds, satisfied justice, and have accepted the
                        gospel of Christ, having the ordinances attended to in their behalf by their living relatives or friends, receive the passport that entitles them to cross the gulf</EM>.

                    <LI>Paradise is not heaven, or the place where God dwells, but a place of departed spirits. Why the belief should be so general that the thief went to heaven with
                        the Savior is rather strange, since Jesus did not go there until after his resurrection. This fact he disclosed to Mary at the tomb. From the time his spirit left
                        his body until he arose from the tomb, Jesus was with the thief in paradise, according to his promise. There the Savior opened the door for the salvation of
                        the dead. Before that time the unworthy dead were shut up in prison and were not visited. (Moses 7:38-39; Isaiah 24:22.) We have good reason to believe
                        that the righteous spirits in paradise did not mingle with the unrighteous spirits before the visit of our Lord to the spirit world. He declared that there was a
                        gulf fixed that could not be crossed which separated the righteous from the unrighteous, therefore there was no sound of the voice of prophets and the Gospel
                        was not declared among the wicked until Christ went into that world before his resurrection. He it was who opened the prison doors. - Isaiah 42:6-7; 61:1.</LI>

                <P>President Brigham Young declared that "Jesus was the first man that ever went to preach to the spirits in prison, holding the keys of the Gospel of salvation to
                    them. Those keys were delivered to him in the day and hour that he went into the spirit world, and with them he opened the door of salvation to the spirits in
                    prison." (J.D. 4:285.) This is in full accord with the scriptures. President Joseph F. Smith, in the vision he beheld of the spirit world, confirmed this view. (<EM>Gos.
                        Doc</EM>., pp. 596-601.) In that world Christ taught the righteous spirits and commissioned them to carry his message and sent them forth among the unbaptized
                    dead. In this way he fulfilled his promise made to Isaiah that he would preach to the spirits of the dead and open their prison doors that they might go free.  (<EM>The

                    <LI>The spirit prison is hell, that portion of the spirit world where the wicked dwell. (Moses 7:37-39.) Before Christ bridged the gulf between paradise and hell -
                        so that the righteous could mingle with the wicked and preach them the gospel - the wicked in hell were confined to locations which precluded them from
                        contact with the righteous in paradise. Abraham told the rich man in hell that between him and Lazarus (who was in paradise) there was a great gulf fixed so
                        that none could go from paradise to hell or from hell to paradise. (Luke 16:19-31.)  Now that the righteous spirits in paradise have been commissioned to
                        carry the message of salvation to the wicked spirits in hell, there is a certain amount of mingling together of the good and bad spirits. Repentance opens the
                        prison doors to the spirits in hell; it enables those bound with the chains of hell to free themselves from darkness, unbelief, ignorance, and sin. As rapidly as
                        they can overcome these obstacles - gain light, believe truth, acquire intelligence, cast off sin, and break the chains of hell - they can leave the hell that
                        imprisons them and dwell with the righteous in the peace of paradise.  (<EM>Mormon Doctrine</EM>, p.755)</LI>
                    <LI>By spirit world is meant the abiding place of disembodied spirits, those who have passed from pre-existence to mortality and have also gone on from this
                        temporal world to another sphere to await the day of their resurrection, final redemption, and judgment. This world is divided into two parts: paradise which
                        is the abode of the righteous, and hell which is the abode of the wicked. (Alma 40:11-14.)</LI>
                </UL>

                <P>Until the death of Christ these two spirit abodes were separated by a great gulf, with the intermingling of their respective inhabitants strictly forbidden. (Luke
                    16:19-31.) After our Lord bridged the gulf between the two (1 Pet. 3:18-21; Moses 7:37-39), the affairs of his kingdom in the spirit world were so arranged that
                    righteous spirits began teaching the gospel to wicked ones. (<EM>Gospel Doctrine</EM>, 5th ed., pp. 473-476.)</P>

                <P>Thus, although there are two spheres within the one spirit world, there is now some intermingling of the righteous and the wicked who inhabit those spheres;
                    and when the wicked spirits repent, they leave their prison-hell and join the righteous in paradise. Hence, we find Joseph Smith saying: "Hades, sheol, paradise,
                    spirits in prison, are all one: it is a world of spirits. The righteous and the wicked all go to the same world of spirits until the resurrection." (<EM>Teachings</EM>, p. 310.)

                    could not speak, but he shook hands warmly with me. I felt for him, and wanted to raise him up, and to have him stay and help us whip the devils and bring to
                    pass righteousness. Why? Because he was valiant, and I loved him. He was a great help to us, and you would be, if you were as valiant as he was, which you
                    can be through faithfulness and obedience.     </P>

                <P>I laid my hands upon him and blessed him, and asked God to strengthen his lungs that he might be easier, and in two or three minutes he raised himself up and
                    talked for about an hour as busily as he could, telling me what he had seen and what he understood, until I was afraid he would weary himself, when I arose and

                <P>He said to me, brother Heber, I have been into the spirit world two nights in succession, and, of all the dreads that ever came across me, the worst was to have
                    to again return to my body, through I had to do it. But O, says he, the order and government that were there! When in the spirit world, I saw the order of
                    righteous men and women; beheld them organized in their several grades, and there appeared to be no obstruction to my vision; I could see every man and
                    woman in their grade and order. I looked to see whether there was any disorder there, but there was none; neither could I see any death nor any darkness,
                    disorder or confusion. He said that the people he there saw were organized in family capacities; and when he looked at them he saw grade after grade, and all
                    were organized and in perfect harmony. He would mention one item after another and say, "Why, it is just as brother Brigham says it is; it is just as he has told
                    us many a time."     </P>

                    had their little child, that died on the Plains, in her arms, and said, "Mr. Grant, here is little Margaret; you know that the wolves ate her up, but it did not hurt
                    her; here she is all right."     </P>

                <P>"To my astonishment," he said, "when I looked at families there was a deficiency in some, there was a lack, for I saw families that would not be permitted to

                <P>He asked his wife Caroline where Joseph and Hyrum and Father Smith and others were; she replied, "they have gone away ahead, to perform and transact
                    business for us." The same as when brother Brigham and his brethren left Winter Quarters and came here to search out a home; they came to find a location for
                    their brethren.     </P>

                <P>He also spoke of the buildings he saw there, remarking that the Lord gave Solomon wisdom and poured gold and silver into his hands that he might display his
                    skill and ability, and said that the temple erected by Solomon was much inferior to the most ordinary buildings he saw in the spirit world.     </P>

                <P>In regard to gardens, says brother Grant, "I have seen good gardens on this earth, but I never saw any to compare with those that were there. I saw flowers of

                <P>After mentioning the things that he had seen, he spoke of how much he disliked to return and resume his body, after having seen the beauty and glory of the
                    spirit world, where the righteous spirits are gathered together.   Some may marvel at my speaking about these things, for many profess to believe that we have
                    no spiritual existence. But do you not believe that my spirit was organized before it came to my body here? And do you not think there can be houses and
                    gardens, fruit trees, and every other good thing there? The spirits of those things were made, as well as our spirits, and it follows that they can exist upon the
                    same principle.     </P>

                <P>After speaking of the gardens and the beauty of every thing there, brother Grant said that he felt extremely sorrowful at having to leave so beautiful a place and
                    come back to earth, for he looked upon his body with loathing, but was obliged to enter it again.  </P>

                <P>    He said that after he came back he could look upon his family and see the spirit that was in them, and the darkness that was in them; and that he conversed
                    with them about the Gospel, and what they should do, and they replied, "Well, brother Grant, perhaps it is so, and perhaps it is not," and said that was the state
                    of this people, to a great extent, for many are full of darkness and will not believe me.     </P>

                <P>I never had a view of the righteous assembling in the spirit-world, but I have had a view of the hosts of hell, and have seen them as plainly as I see you to-day.
                    The righteous spirits gather together to prepare and qualify themselves for a future day, and evil spirits have no power over them, though they are constantly
                    striving for the mastery. I have seen evil spirits attempt to overcome those holding the Priesthood, and I know how they act.     </P>

                <P>I feel well, and I do not feel to condescend to a spirit of mourning. If I do weep, I will weep for my own sins and not for Jedediah. If he could speak he would
                    say, "Weep not for me, but weep for your own sins." (<EM>Journal of Discourses</EM>, 4:135-137)</P>

                    <LI>The veil of forgetfulness of the first estate apparently will not be suddenly, automatically, and totally removed at the time of our temporal death. This veil, a
                        condition of our entire second estate, is associated with and is part of our time of mortal trial, testing, proving, and overcoming by faith-- and thus will
                        continue in some key respects into the spirit world. (The Promise of Discipleship, p. 111)</LI>
                    <LI>We do not now know precisely how God handles things in the spirit world so that life there is an extension of walking by faith. Death does not suddenly
                        bestow upon the disbeliever full awareness of all reality, thereby obviating the need for any faith. Instead, what follows death is a continuum of the basic
                        structure in mortality-until the Judgment Day, when every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ (see Romans 14:11; Philippians
                        2:10; D&amp;C 76:110). Until then, we "walk by faith, not by sight" (2 Corinthians 5:7).    How will God ensure this condition in the spirit world? We do not
                        know. Yet He has certainly so handled the second estate in relation to the first estate, hasn't He? The memories of the first estate are not accessible in the
                        second estate. The spirit world will be so arranged that there will be no legitimate complaints later over the justice and mercy of God (see Mosiah 27:31;
                        Alma 12:15).    Furthermore, the gospel, when preached in the spirit world, will bring the same responses as here: "some believed the things which were
                        spoken, and some believed not" (Acts 28:24). [<EM>That Ye May Believe</EM>. Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1992, pp. 93-94]</LI>

                <P>We read or learn a thing by observation yesterday, and to-day or to-morrow it is gone, unless it be something that impresses us distinctly, that makes a vivid
                    impression upon the mind, that we can remember it perhaps for days, months, and years; but common information and knowledge are constantly coming into
                    our minds, and as constantly being forgotten.  And some of the knowledge we receive here at one time becomes so completely obliterated, through the
                    weakness of the animal system, that we cannot call it to mind, no association of ideas will again suggest it to our minds; it is gone, erased, eradicated from the
                    tablet of our memories.  This is not owing to the want of capacity in the spirit; no, but the spirit has a full capacity to remember; for do you suppose that God in
                    begetting spirits in the eternal world would beget an imperfect thing, that had no capacities?  No.  The Being, who is full of intelligence, knowledge, and
                    wisdom, and acting upon the great principles that are ordained for the generation of living beings, spiritual beings, brings them forth with capacities capable of
                    being enlarged or extended wider and wider; consequently it is not the want of capacity in the spirit of man that causes him to forget the knowledge he may
                    have learned yesterday; but it is because of the imperfection of the tabernacle in which the spirit dwells; because there is imperfection in the organization of the
                    flesh and bones, and in things pertaining to the tabernacle; it is this that erases from our memory many things that would be useful; we cannot retain them in our
                    minds, they are gone into oblivion.  It is not so with the spirit when it is released from this tabernacle.  </P>

                <P>. . . Wait until these mortal bodies are laid in the tomb; when we return home to God who gave us life; then is the time we shall have the most vivid knowledge
                    of all the past acts of our lives during our probationary state; then is the time that we will find that this being we call man--this spirit that dwells within the
                    tabernacle, is a being that has capacity sufficient to retain all its past doings, whether they be good or bad.</P>

                <P>It is, then, this memory that will produce the suffering and the pains upon that class of spirits whose works have been wicked and abominable in the sight of
                    God.  A spirit, then, will remember, that "at such a time in yonder world, and at such a place, I disobeyed the commandments of God; I did not hearken to the
                    counsel of those whom God had appointed to be my counsellors; I did not give heed to the man of God; no: but I rejected his sayings; good counsel was
                    imparted to me, but I did not heed it."  In this life, things that may have been erased from your memory for years will be presented before you with all the
                    vividness as if they had just taken place.  This will be like a worm upon the conscience; it will prey upon the spirit, and produce unhappiness, wretchedness, and
                    misery.  This will cause you to lament, and mourn, and weep after you are cast out from the presence of God--from the home to which you have returned. </P>

                <P>I am speaking now of the wicked.  What is it that produces the opposite principle?  There is an opposition in all things; it is the reflection of the memory that
                    produces joy; that is one of the elements by which joy and happiness are produced upon the spirit of man in the future state; we remember the acts of our past
                    lives that they have been good; we perceive by our memories that we have been obedient to counsel; we perceive that when we have erred through our
                    weakness we have repented of that error; when we have been told of a fault we have forsaken it.  When we look back upon acquaintances and neighbors we
                    perceive that we have observed the golden rule, to do unto others as we would that others should do unto us.  We look back upon our past lives, and we
                    perceive we have never spoken evil against a brother or sister, that we have never striven to stir up family broils, and that we have never desired to injure any of
                    the children of men, male or female.  What do these reflections produce?  They produce joy, satisfaction, peace, consolation, and this joy is a hundred fold more
                    intense that what the spirit is capable of perceiving or enjoying in this life.  Why?  Because just in proportion to the vividness of the conscience, or the memory,
                    so will be the joy.  This you may have knowledge of by every-day experience; just in proportion to the vividness of your ideas, and of the truth set before your
                    minds, and or the good things that are imparted to you, the more intense is your happiness here; how much more intense would it be hereafter, when this mortal
                    clog with all its imperfections has been laid down in the gravel.  The fact is, our spirits then will be happy, far more happy than what we are capable even of
                    conceiving, or having the least idea of in this world. (<EM>Journal of Discourses</EM>, 2:239-240)<STRONG></STRONG></P>

                    <LI>The advantage of this Priesthood that Brother George A. Smith has been talking about is that when persons yield obedience to it, they secure to themselves
                        the sanction of Him who is its author, and who has bestowed it upon the children of men.  His power is around them and defends them; and when they pass
                        into the spirit world they are out of the reach of the power of Satan, and they are not liable to be tempted, hunted, and chased as the wicked are, although the
                        wicked may rest and enjoy far more there than here; but a person who obeys the Priesthood of the Son of God is entirely free from this.  Where the pure in
                        heart are the wicked cannot come.  This is the state of the spirit world. (<EM>Journal of Discourses</EM>, 14:229)</LI>

                        go where both Saints and sinners go; they all go to one place.  Does the devil have power over the spirits of just men?  No.  When he gets through with this
                        earth, he is at the length of his chain. (<EM>Journal of Discourses</EM>, 3:94)</LI>
                    <LI>Is a Saint subject to the power of the Devil in the spirit world?  No, because he has gained the victory through faith, and can command Satan, and he must
                        obey.  How is it with the wicked?  The Devil has power over them to distress and afflict them:  they are in hell. (<EM>Journal of Discourses</EM>, 7:174)</LI>

                    for you to pass away from this state of existence, Satan's power will have ended.  After that he can exercise no dominion over you.  You are emancipated from
                    his thraldom.  You will then be ushered into the presence of the holy and the just.  You will dwell in the paradise of God, waiting with delightful anticipations
                    the time when your spirits and your bodies will be reunited, and when you shall dwell together with the holy, the just and exalted ones in the presence of God

                <P>The spirits of the ancient Gadiantons are around us.  You may see battle-field after battle-field, scattered over this American continent, where the wicked have
                    slain the wicked.  Their spirits are watching us continually for an opportunity to influence us to do evil, or to make us decline in the performance of our duties. 
                    And I will defy any man on earth to be more gentlemanly and bland in his manners than the master spirit of all evil.  We call him the devil; a gentleman so
                    smooth and so oily, that he can almost deceive the very elect.  We have been baptized by men having the authority of the holy Priesthood of the Son of God,
                    and consequently we have power over him which the rest of the world do not possess, and all who possess the power of the Priesthood have the power and right
                    to rebuke those evil powers, and they obey not, it is because we do not live so as to have the power with God, which it is our privilege to have.  If we do not live
                    for this privilege and right we are under condemnation. (<EM>Journal of Discourses</EM>, 12:128)</P>

                <P>It is written, "resist the devil and he will flee from you."  Some people do not believe that there are any devils.  There are thousands of evil spirits that are just as
                    ugly as evil can make them.  The wicked die, and their spirits remain not far from where their tabernacles are.  When I was in England, twenty-eight years ago
                    next June, I saw more devils than there are persons here to-day; they came upon me with an intention to destroy me; they are the spirits of wicked men who,
                    while in the flesh, were opposed to God and his purposes.  I saw them with what we call the spiritual eyes, but what is in reality the natural eye.  The
                    atmosphere of many parts of these mountains is doubtless the abode of the spirits of Gadianton robbers, whose spirits are as wicked as hell, and who would kill
                    Jesus Christ and every Apostle and righteous person that ever lived if they had the power.  It is by the influence of such wicked spirits that men and women are
                    all the time tempted to tell little lies, to steal a little, to take advantage of their neighbor a little, and they tell us there is no harm in it.  It is by the influence and
                    power of evil spirits that the minds of men are prejudiced against each other, until they are led to do each other an injury, and sometimes to kill each other.

                <P>Sometimes the Lord expands our vision from this point of view and this side of the veil, that we feel and seem to realize that we can look beyond the thin veil
                    which separates us from that other sphere. If we can see, by the enlightening influence of the Spirit of God and through the words that have been spoken by the
                    holy prophets of God, beyond the veil that separates us from the spirit world, surely those who have passed beyond, can see more clearly through the veil back
                    here to us than it is possible for us to see to them from our sphere of action. I believe we move and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and
                    of heavenly beings. We are not separated from them. We begin to realize more and more fully, as we become acquainted with the principles of the gospel, as
                    they have been revealed anew in this dispensation, that we are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors, to our friends and associates and co-laborers who
                    have preceded us into the spirit world. We cannot forget them; we do not cease to love them; we always hold them in our hearts, in memory, and thus we are
                    associated and united to them by ties that we cannot break, that we cannot dissolve or free ourselves from. If this is the case with us in our finite condition,
                    surrounded by our mortal weaknesses, shortsightedness, lack of inspiration and wisdom, from time to time, how much more certain it is, and reasonable and
                    consistent, to believe that those who have been faithful, who have gone beyond, are still engaged in the work for the salvation of the souls of men, in the
                    opening of the prison doors to them that are bound and proclaiming liberty to the captives, who can see us better than we can see them -- that they know us
                    better than we know them. They have advanced; we are advancing; we are growing as they have grown; we are reaching the goal that they have attained unto;
                    and therefore, I claim that we live in their presence, they see us, they are solicitous for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. For now they see the
                    dangers that beset us; they can comprehend better than ever before, the weaknesses that are liable to mislead us into dark and forbidden paths. They see the
                    temptations and the evils that beset us in life, and the proneness of mortal beings to yield to temptation and to wrong doing; hence their solicitude for us and

                <P>I believe the eyes of the heavenly hosts are over this people; I believe they are watching the elders of Israel, the prophets and apostles and men who are called to
                    bear off this kingdom. I believe they watch over us all with great interest….  I have had many interviews with Brother Joseph until the last fifteen or twenty
                    years of my life; I have not seen him for that length of time. But during my travels in the southern country last winter I had many interviews with President
                    Young, and with Heber C. Kimball, and George A. Smith, and Jedediah M. Grant, and many others who are dead. They attended our conference, they attended
                    our meetings. And on one occasion, I saw Brother Brigham and Brother Heber ride in carriage ahead of the carriage in which I rode when I was on my way to
                    attend conference; and they were dressed in the most priestly robes. When we arrived at our destination I asked President Young if he would preach to us. He
                    said, "No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh. I shall not talk to this people any more." "But, said he, "I have come to see you; I have come to watch over
                    you, and to see what the people are doing." Then, said he, "I want you to teach the people--and I want you to follow this counsel yourself--that they must labor
                    and so live as to obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the kingdom; without the spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the dark,
                    and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles and as elders in the church and kingdom of God." And, said he, "Brother Joseph taught me this
                    principle."</P>

                <P>And I will here say, I have heard him refer to that while he was living. But what I was going to say is this: the thought came to me that Brother Joseph had left
                    the work of watching over this Church and kingdom to others, and that he had gone ahead, and that he had left this work to men who have lived and labored
                    with us since he left us. This idea manifested itself to me, that such men advance in the spirit world. And I believe myself that these men who have died and
                    gone into the spirit world had this mission left with them; that is, a certain portion of them, to watch over the Latter-day Saints. (<EM>The Discourses of Wilford

                <P><STRONG>Joseph F. Smith</STRONG></P>

                <P> I feel sure that the Prophet Joseph Smith and his associates, who, under the guidance and inspiration of the Almighty, and by His power, began this latter-day
                    work, would rejoice and do rejoice.--I was going to say if they were permitted to look down upon the scene that I behold in this tabernacle, but I believe they do
                    have the privilege of looking down upon us just as the all-seeing eye of God beholds every part of His handiwork. For I believe that those who have been
                    chosen in this dispensation and in former dispensations, to lay the foundation of God's work in the midst of the children of men, for their salvation and
                    exaltation, will not be deprived in the spirit world from looking down upon the results of their own labors, efforts and mission assigned them by the wisdom
                    and purpose of God, to help to redeem and to reclaim the children of the Father from their sins. So I feel quite confident that the eye of Joseph, the Prophet, and
                    of the martyrs of this dispensation, and of Brigham and John and Wilford, and those faithful men who were associated with them in their ministry upon the
                    earth, are carefully guarding the interests of the Kingdom of God in which they labored and for which they strove during their mortal lives. I believe they are as
                    deeply interested in our welfare today, if not with greater capacity, with far more interest behind the veil, than they were in the flesh. I believe they know more;
                    I believe their minds have expanded beyond their comprehension in mortal life, and their interests are enlarged and expanded in the work of the Lord to which
                    they gave their lives and their best service. Although some may feel and think that it is a little extreme to take this view, yet I believe that it is true; and I have a
                    feeling in my heart that I stand in the presence not only of the Father and of the Son, but in the presence of those whom God commissioned, raised up and
                    inspired to lay the foundations of the work in which we are engaged. Accompanying that sense or feeling, I am impressed with the thought that I would not this
                    moment say or do one thing that would be taken as unwise or imprudent, or that would give offense to any of my former associates and co-laborers in the work
                    of the Lord.</P>

                <P>I would not like to say one thing, or express a thought that would grieve the heart of Joseph, or of Brigham, or of John, or of Wilford, or Lorenzo, or any of their
                    faithful associates in the ministry. Sometimes the Lord expands our vision from this point of view and this side of the veil, that we feel and seem to realize that
                    we can look beyond the thin veil which separates us from that other sphere. If we can see by the enlightening influence of the Spirit of God and through the

                    more clearly through the veil back here to us than it is possible for us to see to them from our sphere of action. I believe we move and have our being in the
                    presence of heavenly messengers and of heavenly beings. We are not separate from them. We begin to realize more and more fully, as we become acquainted
                    with the principles of the Gospel, as they have been revealed anew in this dispensation, that we are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors, to our friends

                    with us in our finite condition, surrounded by our mortal weaknesses, shortsightedness, lack of inspiration and wisdom from time to time, how much more
                    certain it is and reasonable and consistent to believe that those who have been faithful, who have gone beyond and are still engaged in the work for the salvation
                    of the souls of men, the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound and proclaiming liberty to the captives who can see us better than we can see them;
                    that they know us better than we know them. They have advanced; we are advancing; we are growing as they have grown; we are reaching the goal that they

                    now they see the dangers that beset us; they can comprehend better than ever before, the weaknesses that are liable to mislead us into dark and forbidden paths.
                    They see the temptations and the evils that beset us in life and the proneness ofmortal beings to yield to temptation and to wrong doing; hence their solicitude
                    for us and their love for us and their desire for our well being must be greater than that which we feel for ourselves. I thank God for the feeling that I possess
                    and enjoy and for the realization that I have, that I stand, not only in the presence of Almighty God, my Maker and Father, but in the presence of His Only
                    Begotten Son in the flesh, the Savior of the world; and I stand in the presence of Peter and James, (and perhaps the eyes of John are also upon us and we know
                    it not); and that I stand also in the presence of Joseph and Hyrum and Brigham and John, and those who have been valiant in the testimony of Jesus Christ and
                    faithful to their mission in the world, who have gone before. When I go I want to have the privilege of meeting them with the consciousness that I have
                    followed their example, that I have carried out the mission in which they were engaged as they would have it carried out; that I have been as faithful in the
                    discharge of duty committed to me and required at my hand as they were faithful in their time, and that when I meet them I shall meet them as I met them here,
                    in love, in harmony, in unison and in perfect confidence that I have done my duty as they have done theirs. (Conference Report, April 1916, pp. 2-3)</P>

                <P>25 I marveled, for I understood that the Savior spent about three years in his ministry among the Jews and those of the house of Israel, endeavoring to teach
                    them the everlasting gospel and call them unto repentance;</P>

                <P>26 And yet, notwithstanding his mighty works, and miracles, and proclamation of the truth, in great power and authority, there were but few who hearkened to
                    his voice, and rejoiced in his presence, and received salvation at his hands.</P>

                <P>27 But his ministry among those who were dead was limited to the brief time intervening between the crucifixion and his resurrection;</P>

                <P>28 And I wondered at the words of Peter--wherein he said that the Son of God preached unto the spirits in prison, who sometime were disobedient, when once
                    the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah--and how it was possible for him to preach to those spirits and perform the necessary labor among them in
                    so short a time.</P>

                <P>29 And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the
                    disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;</P>

                <P>30 But behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go
                    forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead.</P>

                    would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.</P>

                <P>32 Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets.</P>

                <P>36 Thus was it made known that our Redeemer spent his time during his sojourn in the world of spirits, instructing and preparing the faithful spirits of the

                <P>37 That they might carry the message of redemption unto all the dead, unto whom he could not go personally, because of their rebellion and transgression, that

                    <LI>Often Church members suffer from a lack of perspective, perhaps understandably, as to the vastness and intensity of the Lord's work in the spirit world.  The
                        scope is enormous!  Demographers estimate that some sixty to seventy billion people have lived on this planet thus far.  Without diminishing in any way the
                        importance of the absolutely vital and tandem work on this side of the veil, we do need a better grasp of "things as they really will be" (Jacob 4:13). 
                        Otherwise, we can so easily come to regard family history as a quaint hobby and its resulting temple work as something we will get around to later.  Not only
                        does the word <EM>vastness</EM> characterize the work there but so does <EM>intensity</EM>.  (<EM>The Promise of Discipleship</EM>, p. 105)</LI>
                    <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Is one reason we are not told more about the details of God's work in the spirit world perhaps the intimidating larger scale of things there?  The scope of the
                        work there is so large that it might embarrass those of us here.  Probably twelve times the earth's present population live there.  For sure, twelve times as
                        many Presidents of the Church in this dispensation alone are in residence and at work there!  Perhaps God thus protects us in our present provinciality from
                        feeling diminished by considerations of scale.</FONT> (<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM>That Ye May Believe. </EM>Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1992, p 93</FONT>)</LI>

                    the righteous from the wicked, and the wicked were evidently without knowledge as to what fate awaited them. (Luke 16:19-31.) Savior after his crucifixion
                    bridged this gulf and the gospel was carried to those who sat in this darkness and through the instruction of those who held the priesthood, these miserable
                    spirits were taught the gospel. They were granted some measure of blessing according to their works on earth and according to their opportunity or lack of it, to

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The visit of Christ to the spirits in prison was not made in vengeance, to show them that he had power to triumph over the grave, while they, who died without
                    the remission of their sins, should remain in that condition of punishment forever. He took the glorious message of the gospel and proclaimed it to the dead with

                    his sins committed here, if those sins are not unto death? There are many good, honorable men who have wilfully wronged no man, have lived to the best of
                    their opportunities, righteously, yet have not received the gospel, for one reason or another. Where would be the justice in condemning them forever in hell,

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">We learn from the Doctrine and Covenants that eternal punishment, or everlasting punishment, does not mean that a man condemned will endure this

                    of his misdeeds and humbly repents, receiving the gospel, he comes out of the prison house and is assigned to some degree of glory according to his worth and

                <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">That sins are forgiven in the world to come, we need only refer to the words of the Savior: "All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but

                    <LI>When Joseph Smith had laid the foundation of this word he was taken away. There are good reasons why it was so. Jesus sealed his testimony with his
                        blood. Joseph Smith did the same, and from the day he died his testimony has been in force upon the whole world. He has gone into the spirit world and
                        organized this dispensation on that side of the veil; he is gathering together the elders of Israel and the Saints of God in the spirit world, for they have a work
                        to do there as well as here. Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Father Smith, David Patten and the other elders who have been called to the other side of the veil have
                        fifty times as many people to preach to as we have on the earth. There they have all the spirits who have lived on the earth in seventeen centuries - fifty
                        generations, fifty thousand millions of persons who lived and died here without having seen a prophet or apostle, and without having the word of the Lord
                        sent unto them. They are shut up in prison, awaiting the message of the elders of Israel. We have only about a thousand millions of people on the earth, but
                        in the spirit world they have fifty thousand millions; and there is not a single revelation which gives us any reason to believe that any man who enters the
                        spirit world preached the gospel there to those who lived after him; but they all preach to men who were in the flesh before they were. Jesus himself
                        preached to the antediluvian world, who had been in prison for thousands of years. So with Joseph Smith and the elders - they will have to preach to the
                        inhabitants of the earth who have died during the last seventeen centuries; and when they hear the testimony of the elders and accept it there should be
                        somebody on the earth, as we have been told, to attend to the ordinances of the house of God for them. (<EM>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</EM>, p.151)</LI>
                    <LI>The same priesthood exists on the other side of the veil. Every man who is faithful is in his quorum there. When a man dies and his body is laid in the tomb,
                        he does not lose his position. The prophet Joseph Smith held the keys of this dispensation on this side of the veil, and he will hold them throughout the
                        countless ages of eternity. He went into the spirit world to unlock the prison doors and to preach the gospel to the millions of spirits who are in darkness, and
                        every apostle, every seventy, every elder, etc., who has died in the faith, as soon as he passes to the other side of the veil, enters into the work of the ministry,
                        and there is a thousand times more to preach there than there is here.  (<EM>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</EM>, p.77)</LI>
                    <LI>I have felt of late as if our brethren on the other side of the veil had held a council, and that they had said to this one, and that one, "Cease thy work on earth,
                        come hence, we need help," and they have called this man and that man. It has appeared so to me in seeing the many men who have been called from our
                        midst lately. (<EM>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</EM>, p.77)</LI>
                    <LI>And I will here say that every elder of Israel who lays down his life, whether he dies in his bed, or is put to death by the enemies of truth, when he goes into
                        the spirit world his works follow him, and he rests in peace. The priesthood is not taken from him, and he has thousands more to preach to there than he ever
                        had here in the flesh. But it depends upon the living here to erect temples, that the ordinances for the dead may be attended to, for by and by you will meet
                        your progenitors in the spirit world who never heard the sound of the gospel. You who are here in Zion have power to be baptized for and to redeem your
                        dead. (<EM>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</EM>, p.77)</LI>

                        have the perfect peace and assurance that our Heavenly Father's will was done in the calling of your husband and father to the other side of the veil. His

                    <LI>We preside over the great redemptive work for the dead. Before the Savior can present this kingdom to His Father, all the descendants of Shem, Ham and

                        with greater acceleration than it is here. Our work is to officiate in the temples of God for them. We don't build temples until the Church is well established
                        in a country. Our predecessors have prophesied that temples will dot the landscape of North and South America, the isles of the Pacific, Europe, and
                        elsewhere. If this redemptive work is to be done on the scale it must be, hundreds of temples will be needed. Our first step then is to see that nations are

                        striving to do the things of God, only in a much greater degree -- learning, increasing, growing in grace and in the knowledge of the truth.  (<EM>Discourses of

                    <LI>Spirits are just as familiar with spirits as bodies are with bodies, though spirits are composed of matter so refined as not to be tangible to this coarser
                        organization. They walk, converse, and have their meetings; and the spirits of good men like Joseph and the Elders who have left this Church on earth for a
                        season to operate in another sphere, are rallying all their powers and going from place to place preaching the Gospel, and Joseph is directing them, saying, go
                        ahead my brethren, and if they hedge up your way, walk up and command them to disperse. You have the Priesthood and can disperse them, but if any of
                        them wish to hear the Gospel, preach to them.  (<EM>Discourses of Brigham Young</EM>, p.379)</LI>

                <P>I will say here that in my dreams I have had a great many visits from the Prophet Joseph since his death.  The last time I met him was in the spirit world.  I met
                    him at the Temple.  He spoke to me.  Calling me by name, he said, "I cannot stop to talk to you, for I am in a hurry."  I met Father Smith.  He, too, said to me, "I
                    am in a hurry."  I met a great many of the Apostles and others who are in the spirit world, and they all seemed to be in a hurry.  I marveled at this, and wondered
                    very greatly in my mind why anybody should be in a hurry in the Paradise of God.</P>

                <P>I had an interview with the Prophet Joseph afterwards and asked him the question, "Why are you all in such a hurry here?"  I said, "I have always been in a
                    hurry in the world since I was born, but I thought there would be no occasion for it when I died and entered the spirit world."  He replied, "Well, I will tell you: 
                    The Prophets and Apostles in this dispensation have had no time nor opportunity to prepare themselves to go to the earth with the great bridegroom when He
                    goes to meet the bride, the Lamb's wife.  We in this dispensation have not had time.  We have first as much work to perform, to prepare ourselves, as in other
                    dispensations." </P>

                <P>. . . I have had a many interviews with President Young since he died, a great many teachings from him, and from others who held important positions here in
                    the flesh, but who have gone into the spirit world, and seem, in a measure, to have an interest and watch-care over the Church and Kingdom of God though they
                    have passed to the other side of the veil.  (<EM>Collected Discourses</EM>, Vol.2,October 4, 1890)</P>

                    friends now living, officiate for them.  This does not destroy their agency, for although they laid down their bodies and went to their graves in a day of darkness,
                    and they are now mingled with the hosts of spirits in the eternal worlds, their agency still continues, and that agency gives them power to believe in Jesus Christ
                    there, just as well as we can who are here.  Those spirits on the other side of the veil can repent just the same as we, in the flesh, can repent.  Faith in God and in
                    his son Jesus Christ, and repentance are acts of the mind--mental operations--but when it comes to baptism for the remission of sins they cannot perform that,
                    we act for them, that having been ordained to be performed in the flesh.  They can receive the benefit of whatever is done for them here, and whatever the Lord
                    God commands his people here in the flesh to do for them will be published to them there by those holding the everlasting Priesthood of the Son of God.  If,
                    when the Gospel is preached to them there, they will believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, they will receive the benefits of the ordinances performed on their behalf
                    here, and they will be partakers, with their kindred, of all the blessings of the fullness of the Gospel of the Son of God; but if they will not do this they will be
                    bound over in chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day, when they will be judged according to men in the flesh.  We are here in the flesh, and the
                    same Gospel that condemns the disobedient and the sinner here, will, by the same law, condemn those who are on the other side of the veil. (<EM>Journal of

                <P>I have no idea in my mind that every soul that has lived upon the face of the earth, who has died and gone to the spirit world, is going to repent and receive the

                    are full of bitterness and hate towards the truth, but they have a right to have it taught to them. (Conference Report, 1959, p. 23).</P>

                <P>Another principle connected with this subject I want to talk about. A man has married a woman, and they have a family of children. The man lays down in death
                    without ever hearing the Gospel. The wife afterwards hears the Gospel and embraces it. She comes to the temple and she wants to be sealed to her husband,
                    who was a good man. The feeling has been to deny this and to say, "No, he is not in the Church, and you cannot be sealed to your husband." Many a woman's
                    heart has ached because of this, and as a servant of God I have broken that chain a good while ago. I have laid before every woman this principle and let her
                    have her choice. Why deprive a woman of being sealed to her husband because he never heard the Gospel? What do any of us know with regard to him? Will
                    he not hear the Gospel and embrace it in the spirit world? Look at Joseph Smith. Not one of Joseph Smith's fathers or brothers or sisters were in the covenant
                    when he received the keys of the kingdom of God and translated the Book of Mormon. They afterwards received it. Every brother and sister that he had, and his
                    father and his father's brothers, except Uncle Jesse Smith, embraced the Gospel. Now, suppose that any of these had died before they had the opportunity of
                    entering into the covenant with the Lord through the Gospel, as his brother Alvin did; they would have been in the same position as Alvin, concerning whom
                    the Lord, when Joseph saw him in the celestial kingdom, said: "All who have died without a knowledge of this Gospel, who would have received it if they had
                    been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it
                    with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts."</P>

                <P>So it will be with your fathers. There will be very few, if any, who will not accept the Gospel. Jesus while His body lay in the tomb, went and preached to the
                    spirits in prison, who were destroyed in the days of Noah. After so long an imprisonment, in torment, they doubtless gladly embraced the Gospel, and if so they
                    will be saved in the kingdom of God. The fathers of this people will embrace the Gospel. It is my duty to honor my father who begot me in the flesh. It is your
                    duty to do the same. When you do this, the Spirit of God will be with you.  (<EM>Messages of the First Presidency</EM>, 3:257-258)</P>

                <P> It is our opportunity, in this dispensation, and our privilege and duty to spend our time in searching out our dead. We are of the house of Israel. We learn that
                    through revelation; and that being true, then we reach the conclusion, unless we have been adopted through the gospel and were gentiles, that our ancestors
                    were also of the house of Israel. In other words, the promise made to Abraham, that through the scattering of his seed all nations would be blessed, has been
                    fulfilled, and our lineage has come down generation after generation through the loins of Abraham and the loins of Israel.</P>

                <P>Therefore our fathers are more likely to receive the gospel (if they did not hear it in this life, to receive it in the spirit world), than are those whose descendants
                    are not in the Church and who refused to receive the gospel here. (<EM>Doctrines of Salvation</EM>, 2:133)</P>

                <P>Surely those just and honorable mortals who have done so well here with the light they have received are the most likely to respond in paradise and the spirit
                    world, when the fulness of the light of the gospel is given to them there.  Consider the comments of the Prophet Joseph Smith about the important role of
                    spiritual knowledge:</P>

                <P>"Knowledge does away darkness, suspense and doubt, for where Knowledge is there is no doubt nor suspense nor darkness.  There is no pain so awful as the
                    pain of suspense.  This is the condemnation of the wicked; their doubt and anxiety and suspense causes weeping and gnashing of teeth."[Joseph Smith, <EM>The
                        Words of Joseph Smith</EM>.  A. Ehat, and L. Cook (Ed.s).  Provo, UT: Grandin, 1991, p. 183]  </P>

                <P>The "pain of suspense" apparently will necessarily operate to some extent in the spirit prison because of uncertainty-along with a price to be paid as part of
                    repentance for transgressions.  The Prophet Joseph also said:</P>

                <P>"A man is his own tormentor and his own condemner.  Hence the saying, They shall go into the lake that burns with fire and brimstone.  The torment of
                    disappointment in the mind of man is as exquisite as a lake burning with fire and brimstone.  I say, so is the torment of man." [Joseph Smith, The History of the
                    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint, 1932-51, 6:314].  </P>

                <P>The word prison carries with it the connotation of "a state of confinement," including a conceptual confinement.  The Prophet Joseph Smith said, for instance,
                    that God has "made ample provision for their redemption, according to their several circumstance, . . .  Whether in this world, or in the world to come." [Joseph
                    Smith, <EM>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</EM>.  Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1938, p. 220]  </P>

                <P>The Prophet also consoled: "God has administrators in the eternal world to release those spirits from Prison.  The ordinances being administered by proxy upon
                    them, the law is fulfilled."  [Joseph Smith, <EM>The Words of  Joseph Smith</EM>.  A. Ehat, and L. Cook (Ed.s).  Provo, UT: Grandin, 1991, p. 372]  </P>

                <P>Likewise, the Prophet, wen speaking of us and our chance to become "saviors . . . on Mount Zion," instructed as to how the merciful salvation for the dead
                    "places the human family upon an equal footing, and harmonizes with every principle of righteousness, justice and truth." [Joseph Smith, <EM>Teachings of the
                        Prophet Joseph Smith</EM>.  Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1938, p. 223]  (<EM>The Promise of Discipleship</EM>, pp. 111-113)</P>

                    <LI>Perhaps I may be permitted to relate a circumstance with which I am acquainted in relation to Bishop Roskelley, of Smithfield, Cache Valley:</LI>
                </UL>

                <P>On one occasion he was suddenly taken very sick -- near to death's door. While he lay in this condition, President Peter Maughan, who was dead, came to him
                    and said: "Brother Roskelley, we held a council on the other side of the veil. I have had a great deal to do, and I have the privilege of coming here to appoint
                    one man to come and help. I have had three names given to me in council, and you are one of them. I want to inquire into your circumstances.</P>

                <P>The Bishop told him what he had to do, and they conversed together as one man would converse with another. President Maughan then said to him: "I think I
                    will not call you. I think you are wanted here more than perhaps one of the others."</P>

                <P>Bishop Roskelley got well from that hour. Very soon after, the second man was taken sick, but not being able to exercise sufficient faith, Brother Roskelley did
                    not go to him. By and by this man recovered, and on meeting Brother Roskelley, he said: "brother Maughan came to me the other night and told me he was sent
                    to call one man from the ward," and he named two men as had been done to Brother Roskelley. A few days afterwards the third man was taken sick and died.</P>

                <P>Now, I name this to show a principle. They have work on the other side of the veil; and they want men, and they call them. And that was my view in regards to
                    Brother George A. Smith. When he was almost at death's door, Brother Cannon administered to him, and in thirty minutes he was up and ate breakfast with his
                    family. We labored with him in this way, but ultimately, as you know, he died. But it taught me a lesson. I felt that man was wanted behind the veil. We labored
                    also with Brother Pratt; but he, too, was wanted behind the veil. (<EM>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</EM>, pp.290-291)</P>

                <UL>
                    <LI>We lost one of our apostles a short time since. He was about the youngest man in the quorum of the apostles. He was suddenly called away from us. There is
                        a meaning to this. Many times things take place with us that we do not comprehend, unless it is given to us by revelation. But there is a meaning in the loss
                        of that young apostle. I had a manifestation of that while in San Francisco recently.</LI>
                </UL>

                <P>One evening, as I fell asleep, I was very much troubled with evil spirits that tried to afflict me; and while laboring to throw off these spirits and their influence,
                    there was another spirit visited me that seemed to have power over the evil spirits, and they departed from me. Before he left me he told me not to grieve
                    because of the departure of Abraham Hoagland Cannon; for the Lord had called him to fill another important mission in the spirit world, as a pure and holy
                    apostle from Zion in the Rocky Mountains -- a labor which would not only prove a great benefit to his father's household, but to the Church and kingdom of
                    God on the earth. I feel to name this, because it is true. I have become acquainted with many things in our history that I have marveled at. While in the St.
                    George temple I had a son, who was in the north country, drowned. He had a warning of this. In a dream he was notified how he would die. We had testimony
                    of that after his death. I asked the Lord why he was taken from me. The answer to me was, "You are doing a great deal for the redemption of your dead; but the
                    law of redemption requires some of your own seed in the spirit world to attend to work connected with this." That was a new principle to me; but it satisfied me
                    why he was taken away. I name this, because there are a great many instances like it among the Latter-day Saints. This was the case with Brother Abraham
                    Cannon. He was taken away to fulfil that mission. And where we have anything of this kind, we should leave it in the hands of God to reconcile. (<EM>The

                    <LI>Baptism, confirmation, ordination, endowment, and sealings all pertain to this mortal life and are ordinances required of those who are in mortality. 
                        Provision has been made for these ordinances to be performed vicariously for those who are worthy but who died without the opportunity in this life of

                <P>You can readily see that it would be inconsistent for a resurrected being to come and be baptized for the dead.  The resurrected person has passed to another
                    sphere where the laws and blessings do not pertain to this mortal life.  This is equally true of every other ordinance.  If it were permissible for resurrected
                    persons to come and do work in the temples, then there would be no reason for us in this mortal life to act vicariously for them, for they would do it for
                    themselves. (<EM>Doctrines of Salvation</EM>, 2:178)</P>

                    <LI>Temple work is for the purpose of giving to every man and to every woman the blessings of the higher ordinances of the gospel that are essential to salvation
                        in the kingdom of God. There is not an ordinance performed in the temple that does not pertain to this mortal life.</LI>

                <P>When we go into the temple and act for somebody else, we are treating that person as though we were that person living here, doing for him just what he would
                    have to do if he were in mortal life. Thus we bring to pass his salvation, and we learn through these keys the knowledge of God which is made manifest through
                    these ordinances, these blessings, these signs, all that is given to us in the temple of the Lord. (<EM>Doctrines of Salvation</EM>, 2:143)</P>

                        We are confirmed and ordained for them. Why? Because they cannot receive those ordinances there. Why? Because these ordinances pertain to mortal life,
                        and all we are doing for the dead is to give them that which pertains to this mortal existence in which we find ourselves. (<EM>Doctrines of Salvation</EM>, 2:142-143)</LI>

                        principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live
                        according to God in the spirit.  . . . I beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the
                        preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under
                        the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.  The dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances of the house of

                    <LI>It is a great blessing that there can be saviors on Mount Zion.  It is a glorious principle that we can go forth and erect temples and attend to ordinances for the

                <P>Since it is necessary for all who enter the kingdom of God to comply with the ordinances of the gospel, it must be necessary for the dead to conform to this
                    plan. If a man cannot enter the kingdom of God without baptism, then the dead must be baptized. But how can they be baptized in water for the remission of
                    their sins?</P>

                <P>It is easy to understand how they in person could believe in Christ and even obtain the spirit of repentance; but water is an element of this world, and how could
                    spirits be baptized in it, or receive the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost? The only way it can be done is vicariously, someone who is living
                    acting as a substitute for the dead.</P>

                <P>But, says one, this cannot be; it is impossible for one man to stand for another. The answer to this is: The whole system of Christianity is based on vicarious
                    work. One without blemish and without sin standing for all as the Redeemer. You answer, "This is granted in the case of Jesus Christ, for he is God, but it
                    cannot be granted in the case of man for man."</P>

                <P>What of the commandments given by the Lord to Moses in the case of the sin offerings and of the scapegoat for Israel? On the head of the goat Aaron placed
                    his hands and confessed over it all the iniquity of the children of Israel, all their transgressions, and all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and
                    then sent it away "by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness." And the goat bore upon him all their iniquities into the wilderness "unto a land not inhabited."
                    If this was done then, is it beyond the power of the lord to permit a man now to act as proxy for the man who is dead and unable to help himself in person?</P>

                <P>That one man cannot stand or answer for another's sins, but that every man must stand for himself, is true so far as it is possible to be done. But occasions have
                    arisen where the man guilty of transgressing the law was unable to redeem himself. And punishment for sin is for the propitiation of sin, and in such cases there
                    is nothing in the scriptures forbidding one to stand vicariously for another when circumstances render it impossible for the first to comply with the law.
