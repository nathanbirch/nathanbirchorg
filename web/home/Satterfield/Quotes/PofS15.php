                            commandments
                            which help us to become perfect, and the ordinances which constitute

                        ordinances begin with baptism by immersion by
                        proper authority for the remission of sins and for entrance into the
                        earthly
                        kingdom of God. It is followed by the reception of the Holy Ghost,
                        which
                        is promised to every person who qualifies. The priesthood is given,
                        which
                        opens further doors; the endowment is an indispensable feature in
                        preparation
                        for eternal life; and then, the sealing in the holy temple of a man and
                        a woman for an eternal relationship. These are indispensable! No one
                        can
                        ever reach the heights of exaltation and eternal life without all of
                        them.

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Now if it
                        is essential to receive the gospel in
                        order to receive the Christ, what follows? To answer this we must
                        understand
                        and define the gospel. Is the gospel itself anything more than the sum
                        total of the Savior's divine attributes and qualities? I think that all
                        who give careful consideration to the scriptures and the works of the
                        Master
                        will agree that it is. Perhaps the most famous of all definitions of
                        the
                        gospel is that given by Paul when he said: ". . . I am not ashamed of
                        the
                        gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every
                        one
                        that believeth;..." (Romans 1:16.)

                        code for living based upon the attributes of the Savior. <u>The gospel
                            as a power unto salvation must embrace not only all the Christlike
                            characteristics

                            on numerous occasions and in unmistakable terms. He prescribed

                        two gospels --<u> the preparatory gospel</u>
                        and <u>the fulness of the everlasting gospel</u>. There are two
                        proclamations,
                        two pronouncements of glad tidings, two messages of light and truth and
                        power, which God has given to his people at one time or another. What
                        the
                        people receive at any given moment in time depends upon them. The Lord
                        gives them all of his word, or only a portion, depending on "the heed
                        and
                        diligence which they give unto him." If all men had open hearts and
                        receptive
                        minds; if they desired righteousness and sought truth in preference to
                        all else; if they conformed to every true principle they received --
                        all
                        would accept the fulness of his gospel and join that church and kingdom
                        which is always administered for the benefit and blessing of mankind.
                        As
                        it is written: "He that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the
                        lesser
                        portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is
                        given
                        the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the
                        mysteries of God until he know them in full." (Alma 12:9-10.)

                            and the Aaronic or Levitical Priesthood is this: <u>The Melchizedek

                                Priesthood administers the preparatory gospel only</u>, which
                            preparatory
                            gospel is the law of Moses and includes the law of carnal commandments.[<i>The

                            Priesthood of Melchizedek taken away
                            when
                            Moses died?" He replied: "<u>All Priesthood is Melchizedek, but there
                                are
                                different portions or degrees of it</u>. That portion which brought
                            Moses
                            to speak with God face to face was taken away; but that which brought
                            the
                            ministry of angels remained." (Teachings, pp. 180-81.) In other words, <u>there
                                is only one priesthood, but it comes in degrees</u>; it is given
                            partially
                            or it is conferred in its fulness; it comes as the order of Aaron or as
                            the order of Melchizedek. <u>In this same sense, there is only one
                                gospel,
                                one law, one system of salvation, and it comes in degrees</u>. It is
                            all
                            the law of Christ. Salvation comes from no other source. He gives to
                            men
                            as much of his law as they are able to bear. If they can only bear up
                            under
                            the burdens of the lesser system, the schooling system, the preparatory
                            gospel, that is all they receive. Men are given according to their
                            desires
                            and their deeds. [<i>The Mortal Messiah</i>, 1:73]</big></big></li>

                            is plainly pointed out to us as a people the

                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big>God designed when He led Israel
                            out of Egypt to
                            make of that people a royal Priesthood--a kingdom of Kings and Priests.
                            He designed to lead them forward under the guidance of the everlasting
                            Priesthood, the Priesthood after the holy order of the Son of God--to
                            lead
                            them forward until they should behold the face of their God and see Him
                            for themselves. But they would not. They hardened their hearts. They
                            could
                            not endure His presence. Moses, despite all the power which God gave
                            him,
                            and the revelations which He poured out upon him--Moses could not
                            succeed
                            in leading that people forward. They were a stiff-necked race; they
                            were
                            a rebellious race; they were an idolatrous race; they were hard in
                            their
                            hearts; and they would not have God to be their King. They wanted a
                            lower
                            order of affairs; they wanted lower laws, laws that were more in
                            accordance
                            with their fallen and carnal natures. Therefore according to those
                            revelations
                            which God has given unto us, He took Moses out of their midst, and the
                            Holy Priesthood also, and the lesser Priesthood continued, the
                            Priesthood
                            of Aaron, a Priesthood that held the keys of the ministering of angels
                            and the preparatory gospel, the gospel of repentance and baptism for
                            the
                            remission of sins. He left that with them, and the law of carnal
                            commandments
                            which the Lord in His wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron
                            among the children of Israel until John [see D&amp;C 84:23-27]. They
                            were
                            under this law during this long period. God raised up John as a
                            forerunner
                            to prepare the way for the fullness of the everlasting Gospel and the
                            restoration
                            of the Priesthood in its fullness, that Melchizedek Priesthood which
                            Moses
                            held, and through which he exercised such mighty power among the
                            children
                            of Israel. And it was God's design--if the people would have submitted
                            to it, if they would have received the message that He sent unto them
                            through
                            John and afterwards through His beloved Son--to have restored the
                            Kingdom
                            even to Israel, and to have built up the Kingdom in great power and
                            glory
                            upon the earth. But instead of receiving the Gospel and the Melchizedek
                            Priesthood, they actually destroyed the Son of God. But before they
                            destroyed
                            Him, they destroyed the heir of the Priesthood of Aaron, John the
                            Baptist,
                            who was a direct descendant of Aaron, and by virtue of this descent
                            held
                            the keys of that Priesthood, and exercised the authority and power
                            thereof
                            among the Jews. Not content with rejecting the Son of God, they
                            rejected
                            even John, and the Aaronic Priesthood as well as the Melchizedek
                            Priesthood
                            was taken from the midst of the Jews, and they have remained without
                            Priesthood
                            having been withdrawn from their midst--the authority to officiate in
                            the
                            ordinances pertaining thereunto.

                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big>Now, this Priesthood which God
                            has restored in these
                            last days through Peter, James and John, is the Priesthood that
                            continueth
                            in the Church of God in all generations. The Church of God cannot be
                            without
                            it; for without it the power of Godliness is not made manifest to men
                            in
                            the flesh. A people can progress to a certain extent with the Aaronic
                            Priesthood,
                            but there is a limit to their progress. There are bounds beyond which
                            they
                            cannot pass. They cannot attain to the fullness of the glory of God the
                            Eternal Father, without the presence of the Melchizedek Priesthood; for
                            as I have read in your hearing, "This greater Priesthood administereth
                            the Gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even
                            the
                            key of the knowledge of God; therefore in the ordinances thereof,"
                            [that
                            is, in the ordinances of the higher or Melchizedek Priesthood] "the
                            power
                            of Godliness is manifest." This cannot be manifest without that higher
                            Priesthood, without the power which accompanies it. "And without the
                            ordinances
                            thereof," the revelation continues, "and the authority of the
                            Priesthood,
                            the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh; for
                            without
                            this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live."
                            (D&amp;C
                            84:19-22)
                        </big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big>Without this Priesthood, without
                            its ordinances,
                            without its powers, without its gifts, "no man can see the face of God,
                            even the Father, and live." Therefore it is essential that, if a people
                            should be exalted unto the presence of God, they should have this
                            Melchizedek
                            or greater Priesthood, and the ordinances thereof, by the means of
                            which
                            they are to be prepared, or they shall be prepared to enter into the

                            preparatory gospel is a lesser portion of the
                            Lord's
                            saving truths, a portion which prepares and schools men for a future

                            when the fulness of the gospel may be received, a portion which of
                            itself
                            is not sufficient to seal men up unto eternal life or assure them an
                            inheritance
                            in the celestial world. The preparatory gospel "is the gospel of
                            repentance
                            and of baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law of carnal
                            commandments."
                            (D. &amp; C. 84:27.) It is a gospel system administered by the lesser
                            or
                            Aaronic Priesthood. When the power to bestow the Holy Ghost is enjoyed,
                            which power is reserved for holders of the Melchizedek Priesthood, then
                            the fulness of the gospel is manifest. John the Baptist administered
                            the
                            preparatory gospel; Christ came with the fulness of the Melchizedek
                            Priesthood
                            and restored the fulness of the gospel. (John 1:26-27; Acts 19:1-6.) [<i>Mormon

                            Elias do to prepare a people for Him who
                            shall
                            come after? He calls people to repentance and baptizes them in water
                            "for
                            the remission of sins," which freedom from sin is actually obtained
                            when
                            the repentant person receives the baptism of fire and of the Holy
                            Ghost.
                            This was the mission of John. He acted in the power and authority of
                            the
                            Aaronic Priesthood. A forerunner preaches "the preparatory gospel"; the
                            One who comes after preaches the fulness of the gospel. "The
                            preparatory
                            gospel . . . is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the
                            remission
                            of sins." (D&amp;C 84:26-27.) This is the gospel administered by the
                            law
                            of Moses; it was as far as John's authority went. No one is ever
                            prepared
                            for the Lord while he remains in his sins. The Lord does not save
                            people
                            in their sins, but from their sins. The plait of salvation is designed
                            to enable men to free themselves from sin so they can, as clean and
                            spotless
                            beings, enter the presence of Him who is without sin. No one is ever
                            prepared
                            for the Lord until he confesses and forsakes his sins, until he
                            repents,
                            until he is baptized for the remission of sins. And the fact that John
                            was to prepare "a people" for the Lord means that a people -- composed
                            of a host of individuals -- had to set their houses in order, be
                            baptized
                            by him, and await patiently the coming of Him who would give them the
                            Holy
                            Ghost. When they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, sin and evil
                            would
                            be burned out of their souls as though by fire, and being thus clean,
                            they
                            would be fit candidates to be with the Lord they would be prepared for
                            the Lord. [<i>The Mortal Messiah</i>, p.386-387]</big></big></li>

                            of the fulness of the Melchizedek Priesthood and of the kingdom of God

                            belonging
                            to the kingdom of God, even unto the turning of the hearts of the

                            those who are in heaven. . . . Now was this merely confined to the

                            far
                            greater work. Elijah! what would you do if you were here? Would you
                            confine
                            your work to the living alone? No: I would refer you to the Scriptures,
                            where the subject is manifest: that is, without us, they could not be
                            made
                            perfect, nor we without them; the fathers without the children, nor the
                            children without the fathers. I wish you to understand this subject,
                            for
                            it is important; and if you receive it, this is the spirit of Elijah,
                            that
                            we redeem our dead, and connect ourselves with our fathers which are in
                            heaven, and seal up our dead to come forth in the first resurrection;
                            and
                            here we want the power of Elijah to seal those who dwell on earth to
                            those
                            who dwell in heaven. This is the power of Elijah and the keys of the
                            kingdom
                            of Jehovah. Let us suppose a case. Suppose the great God who dwells in
                            heaven should reveal himself to Father Cutler here, by the opening
                            heavens,
                            and tell him, I offer up a decree that whatsoever you seal on earth
                            with
                            your decree, I will seal it in heaven; you have the power then; can it
                            be taken off? No. Then what you seal on earth, by the keys of Elijah,
                            is
                            sealed in heaven; and this is the power of Elijah, and this is the
                            difference
                            between the spirit and power of Elias and Elijah; for while the spirit
                            of Elias is a forerunner, the power of Elijah is sufficient to make our
                            calling and election sure; and the same doctrine, where we are exhorted
                            to go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance
                            from
                            dead works, and of laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead,

                            placed Adam and Eve on this earth, He did so with the purpose in mind

                            (See Moses 6.) To enter into the order of the Son of God is the

                            words, those who keep all the commandments of the Lord. There will be
                            many
                            who are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who
                            shall never become members of the Church of the Firstborn. The higher
                            ordinances in the temple of God pertain to exaltation in the celestial
                            kingdom&#8230;. In order to receive this blessing, one must keep the full
                            law,
                            must abide the law by which that kingdom is governed; for, "He who is
                            not
                            able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial

                            being ordained an elder, or a high priest, or an apostle, or even
                            President
                            of the Church, is not the thing that brings the exaltation, but
                            obedience
                            to the laws and the ordinances and the covenants required of those who
                            desire to become members of the Church of the Firstborn, as these are
                            administered
                            in the house of the Lord. To become a member of the Church of the

                            as I understand it, is to become one of the inner circle. We are all
                            members
                            of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by being baptized
                            and
                            confirmed, and there are many who seem to be content to remain such
                            without
                            obtaining the privileges of exaltation. The Lord has made it possible
                            for us to become members of the Church of the Firstborn, by receiving
                            the
                            blessings of the house of the Lord and overcoming all things. Thus we

                            and ever," with full exaltation. Are such blessings worth having? I
                            have said that only one man at a time on the earth holds the keys of
                            this
                            sealing power of the priesthood, but he may, and does, delegate power
                            to
                            others, and they officiate under his direction in the temples of the
                            Lord.
                            No man can officiate in these sealing ordinances until he receives the
                            authority to do so by being set apart by the one who holds the keys,
                            notwithstanding
                            he may hold the priesthood. All the authority exercised in the temples
                            is then, after all, the authority centered in one man. He has the power
                            and calls upon others to officiate, and they seal upon us the keys and
                            powers which, through our obedience, entitle us to become sons and
                            daughters
                            and members of the Church of the Firstborn, receiving all things in the
                            kingdom. This is what we can get in the temple, so that we become
                            members
                            of the family, sons and daughters of God, not servants. [<i>Doctrines

                    <big><big></big></big><li><big><big>Joseph Smith, the Prophet, said:
                            "Elijah was
                            the last prophet that held the keys of the priesthood, and who will,
                            before
                            the last dispensation, restore the authority and deliver the keys of
                            the
                            priesthood, in order that all the ordinances may be attended to in
                            righteousness.
                            It is true that the Savior had authority and power to bestow this
                            blessing;
                            but the sons of Levi were too prejudiced. 'And I will send Elijah the
                            Prophet
                            before the great and terrible day of the Lord,' etc. Why send Elijah?
                            Because
                            he holds the keys of the authority to administer in all the ordinances
                            of the priesthood: and without the authority is given, the ordinances
                            could
                            not be administered in righteousness." . . . The
                            higher ordinances, the greater blessings which are essential to
                            exaltation
                            in the kingdom of God, and which can only be obtained in certain
                            places,
                            no man has a right to perform except as he receives the authority to do
                            it from the one who holds the keys. It makes no difference how great an
                            office you have, what position in the Church you hold, you cannot
                            officiate
                            unless the keys, the sealing power, is there back of it. That is the
                            thing
                            that counts, and that is why Elijah came; that is why Moses came, for
                            he
                            also held keys of the priesthood; that is why they (Moses and Elijah)
                            conferred
                            upon the heads of Peter, James, and John, in that dispensation, these
                            privileges
                            or these powers, these keys, that they might go forth and perform this
                            labor; and that is why they (Moses and Elijah) came to the Prophet
                            Joseph
