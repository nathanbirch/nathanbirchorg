        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage is
        a partnership. Someone has observed that in the Bible account of the
        creation woman was not formed from a part of man&#8217;s head, suggesting
        that she might rule over him, nor from a part of a man&#8217;s foot that she
        was to be trampled under his feet. Woman was taken from man&#8217;s side as
        though to emphasize the fact that she was always to be by his side as a
        partner and companion. At the marriage altar you are pledged to each
        other from that day to pull the load together in double harness. <small>(<span

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those
        whose limited spiritual understanding precludes a recitation of all the
        facts, the revealed account, in figurative language, speaks of Eve
        being created from Adam's rib. (Moses 3:21-25.) A more express
        scripture, however, speaks of "Adam, who was the son of God, with whom
        God, himself, conversed." (Moses 6:22. Italics added.) In a formal
        doctrinal pronouncement, the First Presidency of the Church (Joseph F.
        Smith, John R. Winder, and Anthon H. Lund) said that "all who have
        inhabited the earth since Adam have taken bodies and become souls in
        like manner," and that the first of our race began life as the human
        germ or embryo that becomes a man. (See Improvement Era, November 1909,
        p. 80.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(From "Eve and the Fall," in <span

<big style="font-family: arial;"><big>Scant
        knowledge is available to us of Eve (the wife of Adam) and her
        achievements in pre-existence and in mortality. Without question she
        was like unto her mighty husband Adam in intelligence and in devotion
        to righteousness during both her first and second estates of existence.
        She was placed on earth in the same manner as was Adam, the Mosaic
        account of the Lord creating her from Adam's rib being merely
        figurative. (Moses 3:20-25.)&nbsp;<small> [From <span

        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eve was formed
            from the rib of Adam. (See
            Genesis 2:22; Moses 3:22; Abraham 5:16.) Interesting to me is the fact
            that animals fashioned by our Creator, such as dogs and cats, have
            thirteen pairs of ribs, but the human being has one less with only
            twelve. I presume another bone could have been used, but the rib,
            coming as it does from the side, seems to denote partnership. The rib
            signifies neither dominion nor subservience, but a lateral relationship
            as partners, to work and to live, side by side.&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(&#8220;Lessons
