                                style="font-family: arial;">In the theology of the restored church of
                                Jesus Christ, the purpose of mortal life is to prepare us to realize
                                our destiny as sons and daughters of God-to become like Him. Joseph
                                Smith and Brigham Young both taught that "no man ... can know himself
                                unless he knows God, and he can not know God unless he knows himself" <small>(in
                                    Journal of Discourses, 16:75; see also The Words of Joseph Smith, ed.
                                    Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook, Provo: Religious Studies Center,
                                    Brigham Young University, 1980, p. 340)</small>. The Bible describes
                                mortals as "the children of God" and as "heirs of God, and joint-heirs
                                with Christ" (Rom. 8:16-17). It also declares that "we suffer with him,
                                that we may be also glorified together" (Rom. 8:17) and that "when he
                                shall appear, we shall be like him" (1 Jn. 3:2). We take these Bible
                                teachings literally. We believe that the purpose of mortal life is to
                                acquire a physical body and, through the atonement of Jesus Christ and
                                by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, to qualify for
                                the glorified, resurrected celestial state that is called exaltation or
                                eternal life.&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(From </small></span></big></big><big><span

                                Man needed experience in the midst of mortal conditions, in order to
                                acquire the education that would fit him for spheres beyond.&nbsp;
                                First, however, he needed a body, for purposes of increase and
                                progression, both in time and in eternity.&nbsp; The spirit without the
                                body is incomplete; it cannot propagate, it cannot go on to glory. . .
                                It is a reasonable inference that spirits advance as far as they can
                                before they are given earthly bodies.&nbsp; Having received these
                                bodies, they are in a position, by means of the Gospel and the powers
                                of the Priesthood, to make further progress toward perfection.&nbsp; <small>(<span

                                We next enquire, What is the object and design of man&#8217;s existence on
                                the earth; and what is his relationship thereto? for all this
                                magnificent world, with its creation, life, beauty, symmetry, order,
                                and grandeur, could not be without design; and as God existed before
                                man, there must have been some object in man&#8217;s creation, and in his
                                appearance on the earth. As I have before stated, man existed before he
                                came here, in a spiritual substance, but had not a body; when I speak
                                of a body, I mean an earthly one, for I consider the spirit is
                                substance, but more elastic, subtle, and refined than the fleshy body;
                                that in the union of the spirit and flesh, there is more perfection
                                than in the spirit alone. The body is not perfect without the
                                spirit,&nbsp; nor the spirit without the body; it takes the two to make
                                a perfect man, for the spirit requires a tabernacle, to give it power
                                to develop itself, and to exalt it in the scale of intelligence, both
                                in time and eternity. One of the greatest curses inflicted on Satan and
                                his followers, when they were cast out of heaven, was, that they should
                                have no body. Hence, when he appeared before the Lord, and was asked,
                                from whence he came, he answered, "From going to and fro in the earth,
                                and from walking up and down in it." Job 1:7. Job 2:2. For this reason
                                he is denominated "The Prince of the power of the air, the Spirit that
                                now worketh in the children of disobedience." Ephes. 2:2. Hence he
                                exerts an invisible agency over the spirits of men, darkens their
                                minds, and uses his infernal power to confound, corrupt, destroy, and
                                envelope the world in confusion, misery, and distress; and, although
                                deprived personally of operating with a body, he uses his influence
                                over the spirits of those who have bodies, to resist goodness, virtue,
                                purity intelligence, and fear of God, and consequently, the happiness
                                of man; and poor erring humanity is made the dupe of his wiles. The
                                Apostle says, "The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them
                                which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who
                                is the image of God, should sine unto them." 2 Cor. 4:4. But not
                                content with the ravages he has made, the spoliation, misery, and
                                distress; not having a tabernacle of his own, he has frequently sought
                                to occupy that of man, in order that he might yet possess greater
                                power, and more fully accomplish the devastation. We read, that in our
                                Saviour&#8217;s days, there were persons possessed with devils, who were
                                tormented by them; and Jesus and his disciples cast them out. Mary
                                Magdalene was dispossessed of seven. A legion had entered one man, and
                                when commanded to leave, rather than have no bodies, they desired
                                permission to enter those of swine, which they did, and the swine were
                                destroyed. Man&#8217;s body to him, then, is of great importance, and if he
                                only knew and appreciated his privileges, he might live above the
                                temptation of Satan, the influence of corruption, subdue his lusts,
                                overcome the world, and triumph, and enjoy the blessings of God in time
                                and in eternity. <small>(<span style="font-style: italic;">The

                                these mortal tabernacles is apparent from the knowledge we have of
                                eternal life. Spirits cannot be made perfect without a body of flesh
                                and bones. This body and its spirit are brought to immortality and
                                blessings of salvation through the resurrection. After the resurrection
                                there can be no separation again; body and spirit become inseparably

                                other than through birth into this life and the resurrection, can
                                spirits become like our Eternal Father. <small>(Conference Report,

                                style="font-family: arial;">Now, this matter of body which, I take it,
                                will come to those who keep their first estate; and those who do not
                                keep their first estate, but who do not belong to the rebellious group,
                                they all get bodies too. We have our bodies. We are not all born in the
                                same circumstances, with the same advantages, and all the rest of it.
                                But evidently the possession of a body was a great consideration, and I
                                refer you, in that connection, to the incident of the Gadarene demons.</span></big></big><br

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">You will remember that when
                                the Savior approached them, they said, &#8220;What have we to do with thee,
                                Jesus, thou Son of God?&#8221; This was one case where the demons,
                                themselves, bore testimony that Jesus was the Christ. &#8220;What have we to
                                do with thee?&#8221;</span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></big></big><br>
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">And then they asked that
                                the Savior, (when he cast them out of the man -- they said they were
                                &#8220;legion&#8221;) that the Savior would permit them to go into the nearby herd
                                of swine. I have always thought that there was a beautiful expression
                                there. They asked him not to send them out into the &#8220;deep.&#8221; You will
                                recall that they went into the swine, and the swine ran down into the
                                sea and were drowned. (Matt. 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39.)</span></big></big><br

                                indicated very, very clearly how valuable an earthly body is, --that
                                they were willing in order to have possession, apparently even for the
                                moment, of a body, to go into the body of a swine. <small>(Conference
