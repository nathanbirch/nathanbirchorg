                            become acquainted with the opposites of happiness and pleasure.&nbsp;
                            The absence of light brings darkness, and darkness an appreciation of
                            light; pain an appreciation of ease and comfort; and ignorance,
                            falsehood, folly, and sin, in comparison with wisdom, knowledge,
                            righteousness, and truth, make the latter the more desirable to
                            mankind.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facts are
                                made apparent to the human mind by their
                                opposites</span>.&nbsp; We find ourselves surrounded in this mortality
                            by an
                            almost endless combination of opposites, through which we must pass to
                            gain experience and information to fit us for an eternal
                            progression...&nbsp; It is the wish of our Heavenly Father to bring all
                            his children back into his presence.&nbsp; The spirits of all the human
                            family dwelt with him before they took tabernacles of flesh and became
                            subject to the fall and to sin.&nbsp; He is their spiritual Father, and
                            has sent them here to be clothed with flesh, and <span
                                style="text-decoration: underline;">to be subject, with
                                their tabernacles, to the ills that afflict fallen humanity</span>.&nbsp;
                            When
                            they have proved themselves faithful in all things, and worthy before
                            Him, they can then have the privilege of returning again to his
                            presence, with their bodies, to dwell in the abodes of the
                            blessed.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If man could
                                have been made perfect, in his double
                                capacity of body and spirit, without passing through the ordeals of
                                mortality, there would have been no necessity of our coming into this
                                state of trial and suffering.&nbsp; Could the Lord have glorified his
                                children in spirit, without a body like his own, he no doubt would have

                            the Scriptures are true, it proves that sin is in the world, and the

                            will the Latter-day Saints say?&nbsp; Is it necessary that we should
                            know good from evil?&nbsp; I can answer this to suit myself by saying
                            it is absolutely necessary, for the simple reason that if we had never
                            realized darkness we never could have comprehended the light; if we
                            never tasted anything bitter, but were to eat sweets, the honey and the
                            honeycomb, from the time we come into this world until the time we go
                            out of it, what knowledge could we have of the bitter?&nbsp; <span

                                me to the decision that every fact that exists in this world is
                                demonstrated by its opposite</span>.&nbsp; If this is the fact--and all
                            true
                            philosophy proves it--it leads me to the conclusion that the
                            transgression of our first parents was absolutely necessary, that we
                            might be brought in contact with sin and have the opportunity of
                            knowing good and evil.&nbsp; It may be deemed strange and singular by
                            the Christian world that we should believe such a thing; but the
                            Scriptures inform us, in Genesis iii., 22, that the Lord God said,
                            &#8220;Behold, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil.&#8221; <small>(<span

                            doubtless, could avert war, prevent crime, destroy poverty, chase away
                            darkness, overcome error, and make all things bright, beautiful and
                            joyful. But this would involve the destruction of a vital and
                            fundamental attribute in man -- the right of agency. It is for the
                            benefit of His sons and daughters that they become acquainted with evil
                            as well as good, with darkness as well as light, with error as well as
                            truth, and with the results of the infraction of eternal laws.
                            Therefore he has permitted the evils which have been brought about by
                            the acts of His creatures, but will control their ultimate results for
                            His own glory and the progress and exaltation of His sons and
                            daughters, when they have learned obedience by the things they suffer.
                            The contrasts experienced in this world of mingled sorrow and joy are
                            educational in their nature, and will be the means of raising humanity
                            to a full appreciation of all that is right and true and good. The
                            foreknowledge of God does not imply His action in bringing about that
                            which He foresees, nor make Him responsible in any degree for that
                            which man does or refuses to do. The comprehension of this principle
                            makes clear many questions that puzzle the uninformed as to the works
                            and power of Deity. <small>(<span style="font-style: italic;">Messages

                            agency.&nbsp; If choice is to exist and agency is to have any meaning,
                            alternatives must be presented.&nbsp; As Lehi phrased it, &#8220;It must
                            needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.&#8221; (2 Nephi
                            2:11)&nbsp; His reasoning and his vocabulary are clear and to the
                            point.&nbsp; Righteousness has no meaning without the possibility of
                            wickedness.&nbsp; Holiness would hold no delight unless we realized the
                            pain of misery.&nbsp; Good could have no moral meaning if nothing could
                            be considered bad.&nbsp; Even life--the nature and eternal
                            possibilities of which are the subject of the plan of salvation and
                            Lehi&#8217;s discourse about it--would have no meaning if we knew nothing of
                            the nature and limitations of death.</big></big><br>
                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big><br>
                            In short, without opposites and alternatives, &#8220;there would have been no
                            purpose in the . . . creation [o human life].&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:12) All
                            experiences in time and eternity would have been common, lifeless,
                            indistinguishable-- &#8220;a compound in one.&#8221;&nbsp; (2 Nephi 2:11)&nbsp; At
                            the end of this sequence would be the worst realization of all.&nbsp;
                            There could be no happiness because there was no sorrow, and there
                            could be no righteousness because there was no sin.&nbsp; But
                            fortunately, there are happiness, righteousness, eternal life, and God,
                            even as Lehi stresses that those blessings come only at the risk of
                            confronting misery, wickedness, death, and the devil. . . .</big></big><br>

                            So Adam and Eve willingly made a choice, choosing the path toward
                            growth and godhood inherent in the fruit of the tree of knowledge of
                            good and evil over the potentially meaningless (at least at that point
                            in their development) tree of life.&nbsp; With the enticement of
                            Lucifer, &#8220;that old serpent that did beguile our first parents, which
                            was the cause of their fall,&#8221; as Abinadi phrase it, they consciously
                            chose to step out of the garden of Eden--a magnificent,
                            terrestrial-like, paradisiacal world--into a fallen, telestial one, a
                            world filled with very unparadisiacal thistles and thorns, sorrow and
                            sin, disease and death.</big></big><br>
                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big><br>
                            In doing so, Adam and Eve answered forever the plaintive question that
                            is so often heard: &#8220;If there is a God, why is there so much suffering
                            in the world?&#8221;&nbsp; The answer to that is we know live in a fallen
                            world filled with opposites, a world in which God is the most powerful
                            but decidedly not the only spiritual influence.&nbsp; As part of the
                            doctrine of opposition, Satan is also at work in the world, and we knew
                            before we came here that he would bring grief and anguish with
                            him.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we (through Adam and Eve) made the conscious
                            choice to live in and endure this mortal sphere of opposition in all
                            things, for only through such an experience was godly progress
                            possible.&nbsp; Adam and Eve--and we&#8212; knowingly and lovingly absolved
                            God of the responsibility for the &#8220;thorns and thistles&#8221; of a fallen
                            world that was personally chosen by us, not capriciously imposed by
                            him.&nbsp; We wanted the chance to become like our heavenly parents, to
                            face suffering and overcome it, to endure sorrow and still live
                            rejoicingly, to confront good and evil and be strong enough to choose
                            the good.&nbsp; In this telestial, mortal world filled with competing
                            voices, enticements, and experiences, we get a lifetime of opportunity
                            to refine and strengthen these virtues. <small>(<span

                            will bring up an example.&nbsp; For instance, suppose you had never
                            tasted anything that was sweet--never had the sensation of
                            sweetness--could you have any correct idea of the term sweetness?&nbsp;
                            No.&nbsp; On the other hand, how could you understand bitter if you
                            never had tasted bitterness?&nbsp; Could you define the term to them
                            who had experienced this sensation, or knew it?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I will
                            bring another example.&nbsp; Take a man who had been perfectly blind
                            from his infancy, and never saw the least gleam of light--could you
                            describe colors to him?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Would he know anything about
                            red, blue, violet, or yellow? No; you could not describe it to him by
                            any way you might undertake. But by some process let his eyes be
                            opened, and let him gaze upon the sun beams that reflect upon a watery
                            cloud, producing the rainbow, where he would see a variety of colors,
                            he could then appreciate them for himself; but tell him about colors
                            when he is blind, he would not know them from a piece of
                            earthenware.&nbsp; So with Adam previous to partaking of this fruit;
                            good could not be described to him, because he never had experienced
                            the opposite.&nbsp; As to undertaking to explain to him what evil was,
                            you might as well have undertaken to explain, to a being that never
                            had, for one moment, had his eyes closed to the light, what darkness
                            is.&nbsp; The tree of knowledge of good and evil was placed there that
                            man might gain certain information he never could have gained
                            otherwise; by partaking of the forbidden fruit he experienced misery,
                            then he knew that he was once happy, previously he could not comprehend
                            what happiness meant, what good was; but now he knows it by contrast,
                            now he is filled with sorrow and wretchedness, now he sees the
                            difference between his former and present condition, and if by any
                            means he could be restored to his first position, he would be prepared
                            to realize it, like the man that never had seen the light.&nbsp; Let
                            the man to whom all the beauties of light have been displayed, and who
                            has never been in darkness, be in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
                            deprived of his natural sight; what a change this would be to him; he
                            never knew anything about darkness before, he never understood the
                            principle at all; it never entered the catalogue of his ideas, until
                            darkness came upon him, and his eye-sight was destroyed: now he can
                            comprehend that the medium he once existed in was light.&nbsp; Now,
                            says he, if I could only regain my sight, I could appreciate it, for I
                            understand the contrast; restore me back again to my sight, and let me
                            enjoy the light I once had; let me gaze upon the works of creation, let
                            me look on the beauties thereof again, and I will be satisfied, and my
                            joy will be full.&nbsp; It was so with Adam; let the way be prepared
                            for his redemption, and the redemption of his posterity, and all
                            creation that groans in pain to be delivered--let them be restored back
                            again to what they lost through the fall, and they will be prepared to
                            appreciate it. <small>(<span style="font-style: italic;">Journal of
