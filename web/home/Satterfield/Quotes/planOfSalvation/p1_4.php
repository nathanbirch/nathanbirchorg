                                should be tempted, that we should be tried, that we should be purified,
                                that the dross of our nature should be cleansed by obedience to the
                                laws of God and that by obedience to His laws these tabernacles which
                                we have received and which belong to this fallen world may be redeemed

                                and its weaknesses, God has given unto us, and He has told us how we
                                can redeem them&#8212;by obeying the laws He has taught.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>&nbsp;

                                ourselves to be tempted, to be drawn aside, to be overcome, or thwarted
                                in the pure and holy purpose that the pure spirit of intelligence (the
                                spirit that is in us) reveals to the understanding.&nbsp; Not but that
                                it is necessary in the very nature of things, in the economy of heaven,
                                that we should be tried and tempted in all things, in order to prove
                                ourselves and prepare ourselves to enjoy that eternal life that is
                                prepared for the just.&nbsp; The time will be when people will not be
                                tempted as they now are--when there will be no Tempter upon the
                                earth.&nbsp; The knowledge and intelligence that will be diffused among
                                the people will enable them to live a time and a season without the
                                Tempter.&nbsp; But we live in a day when the power and rule of that
                                evil principle is more excessive upon the earth that it ever has
                                been.&nbsp; As the Prophet said, &#8220;For every one, from the least even
                                unto the greatest, is given to covetousness; from the prophet even unto
                                the priest, every one dealeth falsely.&#8221;&nbsp; Mankind, in the present
                                day, are further from the intelligence, the light, the glory, and the
                                power of the Invisible than ever they were before, from the days of
                                Adam until now.&nbsp; There never was a day of such heathen darkness
                                and unbelief as now prevails.&nbsp; We have had the privilege of
                                receiving those holy principles calculated to give us power to secure
                                to ourselves eternal life and happiness, if we follow out those
                                principles.&nbsp; It is a constant warfare.&nbsp; As the apostle
                                expresses it, &#8220;The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit
                                against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that
                                ye cannot do the things that ye would.&#8221;&nbsp; The spirit that is put
                                into man is pure and holy; but through the power of evil with the
                                flesh, it is more or less contaminated, influenced, seduced, and
                                brought into bondage by the evil that exists upon the earth.&nbsp; Let
                                the spirit overcome and come off conqueror. <small>(<span

                                is the time to prepare to meet God, which is our first responsibility.
                                Having already obtained our bodies, which become the permanent
                                tabernacle for our spirits through the eternities, now we are to train
                                our bodies, our minds, and our spirits. Preeminent, then, is our using
                                this life to perfect ourselves, to subjugate the flesh, subject the
                                body to the spirit, to overcome all weaknesses, to govern self so that
                                one may give leadership to others, and to perform all necessary
                                ordinances. Secondly comes the preparation for the subduing of the
                                earth and the elements. In Genesis we read: &#8220;And God said, Be fruitful,
                                and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">Our proving grounds vary.
                                Some of us are born with physical limitations; others are lonely or do
                                not enjoy good health. Some are challenged by economic conditions, the
                                lack of good parental example, or a myriad of other things that test
                                our mettle. While much of the pain and sorrow we endure is the result
                                of our own stubborn acts of disobedience, many of the things that
                                appear to be obstacles in our path are used by a loving Creator for our
                                own personal growth.</span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">Life never was intended to
                                be easy. Rather, it is a period of proving and growth. It is interwoven
                                with difficulties, challenges, and burdens. We are immersed in a sea of
                                persistent, worldly pressures that could destroy our happiness. Yet
                                these very forces, if squarely faced, provide opportunity for
                                tremendous personal growth and development. The conquering of adversity
                                produces strength of character, forges self-confidence, engenders
                                self-respect, and assures success in righteous endeavor.</span></big></big><br

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">One who exercises free
                                agency by faith grows from challenges, is purified by sorrow, and lives
                                at peace. In contrast, one who frantically seeks to satisfy appetite
                                and worldly desire is driven in a downward spiral to tragic depths.
                                Temptation is the motivating influence in his exercise of free agency. <small>("The
