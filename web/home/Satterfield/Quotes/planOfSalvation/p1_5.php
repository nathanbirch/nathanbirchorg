                                was said:</span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                Amongst His earliest commands to Adam and
                                Eve, the Lord said: &#8220;Multiply and replenish the earth.&#8221; He has repeated
                                that command in our day. He has again revealed in this, the last
                                dispensation, the principle of the eternity of the marriage covenant.
                                He has restored to earth the authority for entering into that covenant,
                                and has declared that it is the only due and proper way of joining
                                husband and wife, and the only means by which the sacred family
                                relationship may be carried beyond the grave and through eternity. He
                                has declared that this eternal relationship may be created only by the
                                ordinances which are administered in the holy temples of the Lord, and
                                therefore that His people should marry only in His temple in accordance
                                with such ordinances.</span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                The Lord has told us that it is the duty of every husband and wife to
                                obey the command given to Adam to multiply and replenish the earth, so
                                that the legions of choice spirits waiting for their tabernacles of
                                flesh may come here and move forward under God&#8217;s great design to become
                                perfect souls, for without these fleshly tabernacles they cannot
                                progress to their God-planned destiny. Thus, every husband and wife
                                should become a father and mother in Israel to children born under the
                                holy, eternal covenant.</span></big></big><br

                                By bringing these choice spirits to earth, each father and each mother
                                assume towards the tabernacled spirit and towards the Lord Himself by
                                having taken advantage of the opportunity He offered, an obligation of
                                the most sacred kind, because the fate of that spirit in the eternities
                                to come, the blessings or punishments which shall await it in the
                                hereafter, depend, in great part, upon the care, the teachings, the
                                training which the parents shall give to that spirit.</span></big></big><br

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                No parent can escape that obligation and that responsibility, and for
                                the proper meeting thereof, the Lord will hold us to a strict
                                accountability. No loftier duty than this can be assumed by mortals.</span></big></big><br

                                Motherhood thus becomes a holy calling, a sacred dedication for
                                carrying out the Lord&#8217;s plans, a consecration of devotion to the
                                uprearing and fostering, the nurturing in body, mind, and spirit, of
                                those who kept their first estate and who come to this earth for their
                                second estate &#8220;to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord
                                their God shall command them.&#8221; (Abraham 3:25 ) To lead them to keep
                                their second estate is the work of motherhood and &#8220;they who keep their
                                second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and
                                ever.&#8221; (op. cit.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></big><br

                                This divine service of motherhood can be rendered only by mothers. It
                                may not be passed to others. Nurses cannot do it; public nurseries
                                cannot do it; hired help cannot do it--only mother, aided as much as
                                may be by the loving hands of father, brothers, and sisters, can give
                                the full needed measure of watchful care.</span></big></big><br

                                The mother who entrusts her child to the care of others, that she may
                                do non-motherly work, whether for gold, for fame, or for civic service,
                                should remember that &#8220;a child left to himself bringeth his mother to
                                shame.&#8221; (Prop. 29: 15) In our day the Lord has said that unless parents
                                teach their children the doctrines of the Church &#8220;the sin be upon the
                                heads of the parents.&#8221; (D. &amp; C 68:25)</span></big></big><br

                                Motherhood is near to divinity. It is the highest, holiest service to
                                be assumed by mankind. It places her who honors its holy calling and
                                service next to the angels. To you mothers in Israel we say God bless
                                and protect you, and give you the strength and courage, the faith and
                                knowledge, the holy love and consecration to duty, that shall enable
                                you to fill to the fullest measure the sacred calling which is yours.
                                To you mothers and mothers-to-be we say: Be chaste, keep pure, live
                                righteously, that your posterity to the last generation may call you
                                blessed. <small>(Conference Report, October 1942, p.12-13)</small></span></big></big><br

                                present-day difficulties? Postponement of marriage is not the answer. I
                                know that there are many parents whose sons and daughters are
                                struggling for an education who say it would be better if young couples
                                postponed marriage until after they gained an education. I am not so
                                sure about it. Each case must be considered on its merits. The
                                principal thing is to be sure the couple love each other. Marriage
                                without love will bring misery. But if they are sure they are mated and
                                have the same ideals, generally early marriages are best.</span></big></big><br

                                There was a time in the beginning of this
                                country&#8212;it goes back before the beginning of this country&#8212;when every
                                girl was given a dowry, and we still have the practice of a girl&#8217;s
                                preparing a trousseau, which is a commendable practice. I think where
                                parents can help they should help young couples, especially those who
                                have five or six years ahead in getting a college degree. We still
                                retain also the bridal shower, at which, in some countries, people give
                                money.</span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                &nbsp;I think the government is doing a good thing
                                in giving our returned servicemen a few dollars to help them get a
                                start after their having been discharged from the service. Recently I
                                heard a most interesting report on this subject. The incident happened
                                in Logan at the dedicatory service of a quonset house dedicated for
                                worship on the campus of the Utah State Agricultural College. There
                                were present a number of young married couples, young wives with babes
                                in their arms. At the beginning of the dedicatory services, the
                                presiding officer said, &#8220;We have many babes here today. If there be
                                people present who do not like the crooning of babies, we will wait a
                                few minutes now for these people to leave.&#8221; To encourage thus the
                                rearing of families is most commendable. That house was built expressly
                                for young folk rearing families, young G.I.&#8217;s who have started out to
                                build their homes even while they are getting an education.. <small>(<span

                <ul>
                    <li><big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">John and Mary,
                                tomorrow when I repeat the phrases which will bind you for eternity, I
                                shall say the same impressive words which the Lord said to that
                                handsome youth and his lovely bride in the Garden of Eden: &#8220;Be
                                fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.&#8221; (Genesis 1:28.) The
                                Lord does not waste words. He meant what he said. You did not come on
                                earth just to &#8220;eat, drink, and be merry.&#8221; You came knowing full well
                                your responsibilities. You came to get for yourself a mortal body which
                                could become perfected and immortalized, and you understood that you
                                were to act in partnership with God in providing bodies for other
                                spirits equally anxious to come to the earth for righteous purposes.
                                And so you will not postpone parenthood. There will be rationalists who
                                will name to you numerous reasons for postponement. Of course, it will
                                be harder to get your college degrees or your financial starts with a
                                family, but strength like yours will be undaunted in the face of
                                difficult obstacles. Have your family as the Lord intended. Of course
                                it is expensive, but you will find a way, and besides, it is often
                                those children who grow up with responsibility and hardships who carry
                                on the world and its work. And, John and Mary, do not limit your family
                                as the world does.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t think you will love the later ones less
                                or have fewer material things for them. Perhaps, like Jacob, you might
                                love the eleventh one most. Young folk, have your family, love them,
                                sacrifice for them, teach them righteousness, and you will be blessed
                                and happy all the days of your eternal lives.<small> (<span

                                the whole program in the beginning with a father who procreates,
                                provides, and loves and directs, and a mother who conceives and bears
                                and nurtures and feeds and trains. The Lord could have organized it
                                otherwise but chose to have a unit with responsibility and purposeful
                                associations where children train and discipline each other and come to
                                love, honor, and appreciate each other. The family is the great plan of
                                life as conceived and organized by our Father in Heaven.&nbsp;</span></big></big><big><big><span
