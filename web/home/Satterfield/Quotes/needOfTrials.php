                        doubtless, could avert
                        war, prevent crime, destroy poverty, chase away darkness, overcome
                        error,
                        and make all things bright, beautiful and joyful. But this would
                        involve
                        the destruction of a vital and fundamental attribute in man -- the
                        right
                        of agency. It is for the benefit of His sons and daughters that they
                        become
                        acquainted with evil as well as good, with darkness as well as light,
                        with
                        error as well as truth, and with the results of the infraction of
                        eternal
                        laws. Therefore he has permitted the evils which have been brought
                        about
                        by the acts of His creatures, but will control their ultimate results
                        for
                        His own glory and the progress and exaltation of His sons and
                        daughters,
                        when they have learned obedience by the things they suffer. The
                        contrasts
                        experienced in this world of mingled sorrow and joy are educational in
                        their nature, and will be the means of raising humanity to a full
                        appreciation
                        of all that is right and true and good. The foreknowledge of God does
                        not
                        imply His action in bringing about that which He foresees, nor make Him
                        responsible in any degree for that which man does or refuses to do. The
                        comprehension of this principle makes clear many questions that puzzle
                        the uninformed as to the works and power of Deity.<small><small> <big>(<i>Messages

                            destroy." This is the principle on which the government of heaven is
                            conducted--by
                            revelation adapted to the circumstances in which the children of the

                            every

                            happiness
                            and pleasure. The absence of light brings darkness, and darkness an

                            of light; pain an appreciation of ease and comfort; and ignorance,

                            of things. Like heavenly beings, we are endowed with the power of free
                            volition; for God has given to mankind their agency, making them
                            amenable
                            to him for their sins, and entitling them to blessings and rewards for
                            the good they do, and according to their faith in him. It is the wish
                            of
                            our Heavenly Father to bring all his children back into his presence.
                            The
                            spirits of all the human family dwelt with him before they took
                            tabernacles
                            of flesh and became subject to the fall and to sin. He is their
                            spiritual
                            Father, and has sent them here to be clothed with flesh, and to be
                            subject,
                            with their tabernacles, to the ills that afflict fallen humanity. When
                            they have proved themselves faithful in all things, and worthy before
                            Him,
                            they can then have the privilege of returning again to his presence,
                            with

                    <li><big><big>If the Scriptures are true, it proves that sin is in
                            the world, and the
                            question arises, Is it necessary that sin should be here? What will the
                            Latter-day Saints say? Is it necessary that we should know good from
                            evil?
                            I can answer this to suit myself by saying it is absolutely necessary,
                            for the simple reason that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if
                                we had never realized darkness we never
                                could
                                have comprehended the light</span>; if we never tasted anything bitter,
                            but
                            were
                            to eat sweets, the honey and the honeycomb, from the time we come into
                            this world until the time we go out of it, what knowledge could we have
                            of the bitter? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This leads me
                                to the decision that every fact that
                                exists
                                in this world is demonstrated by its opposite</span>. If this is the
                            fact--and
                            all true philosophy proves it--<span style="text-decoration: underline;">it
                                leads me to the conclusion that the
                                transgression
                                of our first parents was absolutely necessary, that we might be brought
                                in contact with sin and have the opportunity of knowing good and evil</span>.

                            believe such a thing; but the Scriptures inform us, in Genesis iii.,
                            22,
                            that the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become as one of us, to

                            will bring up an example.
                            For instance, suppose you had never tasted anything that was
                            sweet--never
                            had the sensation of sweetness--could you have any correct idea of the
                            term sweetness? No. On the other hand, how could you understand bitter
                            if you never had tasted bitterness? Could you define the term to them
                            who
                            had experienced this sensation, or knew it? No. I will bring another
                            example.
                            Take a man who had been perfectly blind from his infancy, and never saw
                            the least gleam of light--could you describe colors to him? No. Would
                            he
                            know anything about red, blue, violet, or yellow? No; you could not
                            describe
                            it to him by any way you might undertake. But by some process let his
                            eyes
                            be opened, and let him gaze upon the sun beams that reflect upon a
                            watery
                            cloud, producing the rainbow, where he would see a variety of colors,
                            he
                            could then appreciate them for himself; but tell him about colors when
                            he is blind, he would not know them from a piece of earthenware. So
                            with
                            Adam previous to partaking of this fruit; good could not be described
                            to
                            him, because he never had experienced the opposite. As to undertaking
                            to
                            explain to him what evil was, you might as well have undertaken to
                            explain,
                            to a being that never had, for one moment, had his eyes closed to the
                            light,
                            what darkness is.

                                good and evil was placed there that man might gain certain information
                                he never could have gained otherwise; by partaking of the forbidden
                                fruit
                                he experienced misery, then he knew that he was once happy, previously
                                he could not comprehend what happiness meant, what good was; but now he
                                knows it by contrast, now he is filled with sorrow and wretchedness,
                                now
                                he sees the difference between his former and present condition, and if
                                by any means he could be restored to his first position, he would be
                                prepared
                                to realize it, like the man that never had seen the light. Let the man
                                to whom all the beauties of light have been displayed, and who has
                                never
                                been in darkness, be in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, deprived
                                of his natural sight; what a change this would be to him; he never knew
                                anything about darkness before, he never understood the principle at
                                all;
                                it never entered the catalogue of his ideas, until darkness came upon
                                him,
                                and his eye-sight was destroyed: now he can comprehend that the medium
                                he once existed in was light. Now, says he, if I could only regain my
                                sight,
                                I could appreciate it, for I understand the contrast; restore me back
                                again
                                to my sight, and let me enjoy the light I once had; let me gaze upon
                                the
                                works of creation, let me look on the beauties thereof again, and I
                                will
                                be satisfied, and my joy will be full. It was so with Adam; let the way
                                be prepared for his redemption, and the redemption of his posterity,
                                and
                                all creation that groans in pain to be delivered--let them be restored
                                back again to what they lost through the fall, and they will be
                                prepared
                                to appreciate it. </span><small style="font-family: arial;">(<i>Journal

                            is necessary that we pass through
                            certain
                            ordeals, and that we be tried. But why is it that we should be tried?
                            There
                            is just the same necessity for it now that there was in former times. I
                            heard the Prophet Joseph say, in speaking to the Twelve on one
                            occasion:
                            "You will have all kinds of trials to pass through. And it is quite as
                            necessary for you to be tried as it was for Abraham and other men of
                            God,
                            and (said he) God will feel after you, and He will take hold of you and
                            wrench your very heart strings, and if you cannot stand it you will not
                            be fit for an inheritance in the Celestial Kingdom of God." Some people
                            have wondered why so many of the Twelve fell away. God tries people
                            according
                            to the position they occupy. <small>(<i>Journal of Discourses </i></small></big></big><big

                            tried. I heard Joseph
                            Smith say--and I presume Brother Snow heard him also--in preaching to
                            the
                            Twelve in Nauvoo, that the Lord would get hold of their heart strings
                            and
                            wrench them, and that they would have to be tried as Abraham was tried.
                            Well, some of the Twelve could not stand it. They faltered and fell by
                            the way. It was not everybody that could stand what Abraham stood. And
                            Joseph said that if God had known any other way whereby he could have
                            touched
                            Abraham's feelings more acutely and more keenly he would have done so. <small>(<i>Journal

                            us and to prove us. We were true in keeping our first estate. The
                            people
                            that are here today stood loyally by God and by Jesus, and they did not

                            Priesthood

                            you did not waver is to be found in the fact that you have received the
                            Gospel and the everlasting Priesthood.&nbsp; Now you are in your second
                            estate, and you are going to be tested again. Will you be true and
                            loyal
                            to God with the curtain drawn between you and Him, shut out from His

                            God will exalt, because it will be the highest test to which they can

                            laws of exaltation,
                            that we should descend from our heavenly abode and come here and take

                            that we should be tempted, that we should be tried, that we should be

                            far beyond anything that we know anything of at the present time. These

                            God has given unto us, and He has told us how we can redeem them--by
                            obeying

                            understand! The Lord said through
                            Joseph
                            Smith: "Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although

                            transpire."
                            (Scrapbook of Mormon Literature, vol. 2, p. 173.)&nbsp; When men obey
                            commands
                            of a creator, it is not blind obedience. How different is the cowering
                            of a subject to his totalitarian monarch and the dignified, willing
                            obedience
                            one gives to his God. The dictator is ambitious, selfish, and has
                            ulterior
                            motives. God's every command is righteous, every directive purposeful,
                            and all for the good of the governed. The first may be blind obedience,
                            but the latter is certainly faith obedience. The patriarch Abraham,
                            sorely
                            tried, obeyed faithfully when commanded by the Lord to offer his son
                            Isaac
                            upon the altar. Blind obedience? No. He knew that God would require
                            nothing
                            of him which was not for his ultimate good. How that good could be
                            accomplished
                            he did not understand. <small>(<i>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball </i>[1982],

                    <li><big><big>Now, this mortal life is the time to prepare to meet
                            God, which is our
                            first responsibility. Having already obtained our bodies, which become
                            the permanent tabernacle for our spirits through the eternities, now we
                            are to train our bodies, our minds, and our spirits. Preeminent, then,
                            is our using this life to perfect ourselves, to subjugate the flesh,
                            subject
                            the body to the spirit, to overcome all weaknesses, to govern self so

                            ordinances.
                            Secondly comes the preparation for the subduing of the earth and the
                            elements.
                            In Genesis we read: "And God said, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
                            replenish

                            men's reasoning. There will be times when
                            you will have to choose between the revelations of God and the
                            reasoning
                            of men--between the prophet and the politician or professor. Said the
                            Prophet
                            Joseph Smith, "Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is,
                            although
                            we may not see the reason thereof until long after the events
                            transpire." <small>(<i>Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson</i> [1988], p.134)</small></big></big><br>

                            said the Lord, "to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord

                            the will of the Lord and then do it. <small>(<span

                                ground. God said, "We will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And

                                will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever

                                Some of us are born with physical limitations; others are lonely or do
                                not enjoy good health. Some are challenged by economic conditions, the
                                lack of good parental example, or a myriad of other things that test
                                our
                                mettle. While much of the pain and sorrow we endure is the result of
                                our
                                own stubborn acts of disobedience, many of the things that appear to be
                                obstacles in our path are used by a loving Creator for our own personal
                                growth.

                                to be easy. Rather, it is a period of proving and growth. It is
                                interwoven
                                with difficulties, challenges, and burdens. We are immersed in a sea of
                                persistent, worldly pressures that could destroy our happiness. Yet
                                these
                                very forces, if squarely faced, provide opportunity for tremendous

                                growth and development. The conquering of adversity produces strength

                                character, forges self-confidence, engenders self-respect, and assures
                                success in righteous endeavor.
