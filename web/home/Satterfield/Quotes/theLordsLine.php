                <p><font size="5">There are two influences in the world today, and have
                    been from the beginning. One is an influence that is constructive, that
                    radiates happiness and builds character. The other influence is one
                    that destroys, turns men into demons, tears down and discourages. We
                    are all susceptible to both. The one comes from our Heavenly Father,
                    and the other comes from the source of evil that has been in the world
                    from the beginning, seeking to bring about the destruction of the human
                    family. The war that is being waged today is being fought by people who
                    have not had the inspiration of the Almighty. It has been forced upon
                    the world by those who have listened to the tempter, who would destroy
                    all happiness in this life and in the life to come. Therefore we should
                    take advantage of our privileges and realize that there is something
                    for us to think about before we move and each time be sure that we are
                    right and then go forward. </font></p>
                <p><font size="5">My grandfather used to say to his family, "There is a
                    line of demarkation, well defined, between the Lord's territory and the
                    devil's. If you will stay on the Lord's side of the line you will be
                    under his influence and will have no desire to do wrong; but if you
                    cross to the devil's side of the line one inch, you are in the
                    tempter's power, and if he is successful, you will not be able to think
                    or even reason properly, because you will have lost the spirit of the
                    Lord."</font></p>
                <p><font size="5">When I have been tempted sometimes to do a certain
                    thing, I have asked myself, "Which side of the line am I on?" If I
                    determined to be on the safe side, the Lord's side, I would do the
                    right thing every time. So when temptation comes, think prayerfully
                    about your problem, and the influence of the spirit of the Lord will
                    enable you to decide wisely. There is safety for us only on the Lord's
                    side of the line. </font></p>
                <p><font size="5">If you want to be happy, remember, that all happiness
                    worthy of the name is on the Lord's side of the line and all sorrow and
                    disappointment is on the devil's side of the line. </font>(<i>Sharing
