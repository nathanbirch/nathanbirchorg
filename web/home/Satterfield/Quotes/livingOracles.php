                            We are admonished to &#8220;seek out of the best books words of wisdom&#8221;
                            (D&amp;C 88:118). Surely these books must include the scriptures.
                            Alongside them must be the words of the Presidents of the Church. The
                            Lord said of the President of the Church, &#8220;His word ye shall receive,
                            as if from mine own mouth&#8221; (D&amp;C 21:5). These books make up what has
                            been referred to as &#8220;the Lord&#8217;s library&#8221;&#8212;namely the standard works and
                            the various volumes that contain the words of the different Presidents
                            of the Church. Of the latter volumes, that which would be of greatest
                            importance to you would be the words of the current President of the
                            Church, for his words are directed to our day and our needs. (<span

                            I will refer to a certain meeting I attended in the town of Kirtland in
                            my early days. At that meeting some remarks were made that have been
                            made here today, with regard to the living oracles and with regard to
                            the written word of God. The same principle was presented, although not
                            as extensively as it has been here, when a leading man in the Church
                            got up and talked upon the subject, and said: &#8220;You have got the word of
                            God before you here in the Bible, Book of Mormon, and Doctrine and
                            Covenants; you have the written word of God, and you who give
                            revelations should give revelations according to those books, as what
                            is written in those books is the word of God. We should confine
                            ourselves to them.&#8221; When he concluded, Brother Joseph turned to Brother
                            Brigham Young and said, &#8220;Brother Brigham I want you to take the stand
                            and tell us your views with regard to the written oracles and the
                            written word of God.&#8221; Brother Brigham took the stand, and he took the
                            Bible, and laid it down; he took the Book of Mormon, and laid it down;
                            and he took the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and laid it down before
                            him, and he said: &#8220;There is the written word of God to us, concerning
                            the work of God from the beginning of the world, almost, to our day.&#8221;
                            &#8220;And now,&#8221; said he, &#8220;when compared with the living oracles those books
                            are nothing to me; those books do not convey the word of God direct to
                            us now, as do the words of a Prophet or a man bearing the Holy
                            Priesthood in our day and generation. I would rather have the living
                            oracles than all the [p.23]writing in the books.&#8221; That was the course
                            he pursued. When he was through, Brother Joseph said to the
                            congregation: &#8220;Brother Brigham has told you the word of the Lord, and
                            he has told you the truth.&#8221;&nbsp; (Conference Report, October 1897,
                            p.22)</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
