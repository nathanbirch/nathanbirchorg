                <p><big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">The term Holy Ghost and
                            its common
                            synonyms, Spirit of God, Spirit of the Lord, or simply, Spirit,
                            Comforter, and Spirit of Truth, occur in the scriptures with plainly
                            different meanings, referring in some cases to the person of God the
                            Holy Ghost, and in other instances to the power or authority of this
                            great Personage, <span style="font-style: italic;">or to the agencies
                                through which He ministers</span>. The
                            context of such passages show which of these significations applies. ...</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">Much of the confusion existing in
                            human conceptions concerning the nature of the Holy Ghost arises from
                            <span style="font-style: italic;">the common failure to segregate His
                                person and powers</span>. Plainly, such
                            expressions as being filled with the Holy Ghost, and His falling upon
                            persons, having reference to the powers and influences that emanate
                            from God, and which are characteristic of Him; for the Holy Ghost may
                            in this way operate simultaneously upon many persons even though they
                            be widely separated, whereas the actual person of the Holy Ghost cannot
                            be in more than one place at a time. <span style="font-style: italic;">Yet
                                we read that through the power
                                of the Spirit, the Father and the Son operate in their creative acts
                                and in their general dealings with the human family</span>. <span
                                style="font-style: italic;">The Holy Ghost may be regarded as the
                                minister of the Godhead, carrying into effect the decision of the
                                Supreme Council</span>.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">

                            execution of these great purposes, the Holy Ghost directs and controls
                            the varied forces of nature, of which indeed a few, and these perhaps
                            of minor order wonderful as even the least of them appears to man, have
                            thus far been investigated by mortals. Gravitation, sound, heat, light,
                            and the still more mysterious and seemingly super-natural power of
                            electricity, are but the common servants of the Holy Ghost in His
                            operations.</big></big> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Articles of
