                                        Who, then, are the Jews, and what part shall they yet play in the
                                        gathering of Israel and the return of their King? There is a maze of
                                        fuzzy thinking and shoddy scholarship, both in the world and in the
                                        Church, that seeks to identify the Jews, both ancient and modern, and
                                        to expound upon what they have believed and do believe. It is not
                                        strange that the divines of the day-not knowing that the kingdom is to
                                        be restored to Israel at that glorious day; not having the Book of
                                        Mormon and latter-day revelation to guide them-it is not strange that
                                        they come up with false and twisted views about the mission and destiny
                                        of the Jews. It is a little sad that church members sometimes partake
                                        of these false views and of this secular spirit so as to misread the
                                        signs of the times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></big><br

                                        The term Jew is a contraction of the name Judah, but the Jews are not
                                        the members of the tribe of Judah as such. After the reign of Solomon,
                                        the Lord's people divided into the kingdom of Israel&nbsp; and the
                                        kingdom of Judah. Nearly ten tribes served Jeroboam in Israel and two
                                        and a half tribes served Rehoboam in Judah. The Levites were scattered
                                        among all the tribes. Judah, Simeon, and part of Benjamin comprised the
                                        kingdom of Judah. In actual fact, and considering blood lineage only,
                                        both kingdoms had in them people from all of the tribes. Lehi, who
                                        lived in Judah and was a Jew, was of the tribe of Manasseh. The Jews
                                        were nationals of the kingdom of Judah without reference to tribal
                                        ancestry. Thus the descendants of Lehi, both the Nephites and the
                                        Lamanites, were Jews because they came out from Jerusalem and from the
                                        kingdom of Judah. (2 Ne. 33:8.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></big><br

                                        The Jews today are also those whose origins stem back to the kingdom of
                                        their fathers. Clearly the dominant tribe-dominant, however, only in
                                        the sense of political power and rulership-was Judah. As to the
                                        bloodlines, who knows whether there are more of Judah or of Simeon or
                                        of Benjamin or of some other tribe among the Jews as we know them?
                                        Paul, a Jew, was of the tribe of Benjamin. The name Judea, now used as
                                        a noun, is actually an adjective meaning Jewish and is the Greek and
                                        Roman designation for the land of Judah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></big><br

                                        Since the Ten Tribes were taken into Assyria and lost from the
                                        knowledge of their fellows more than a century before the Jews went
                                        into Babylonian captivity, the prophets began to speak of Jews and
                                        Gentiles and to consider as a Gentile everyone who was not a Jew. This
                                        classifies Ephraim and the rest of scattered Israel as Gentiles.
                                        Everyone, in this sense, who is not a Jew is a Gentile, a concept that
                                        will enable us, in due course, to set forth what is meant by the
                                        fulness of the Gentiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> (</small></span></big></big><big><span
