                                than avoiding, overcoming, and being cleansed from sin and the bad
                                influences in our lives; it also essentially entails doing good, being
                                good, and becoming better. Repenting of our sins and seeking
                                forgiveness are spiritually necessary, and we must always do so. But
                                remission of sin is not the only or even the ultimate purpose
                                of the gospel. To have our hearts changed by the Holy Spirit such that
                                "we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually"
                                (Mosiah 5:2), as did King Benjamin's people, is the
                                covenant responsibility we have accepted. This mighty change is not
                                simply the result of working harder or developing greater individual
                                discipline. Rather, it is the consequence of a
                                fundamental change in our desires, our motives, and our natures made
                                possible through the Atonement of Christ the Lord. Our spiritual
                                purpose is to overcome both sin and the desire to sin,
                                both the taint and the tyranny of sin.</big></big></font></big></big></p>

                                teachings of King Benjamin concerning the mission and Atonement of
                                Jesus Christ. The simple doctrine he taught caused the congregation to
                                fall to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them. "And
                                they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than
                                the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one
                                voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that
                                we may <em>receive forgiveness of our sins</em>, and our <em>hearts

                                the strait and narrow path and make steady progress toward our eternal
                                destiny. The Lord's pattern for spiritual development is "line upon
                                line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little" (2 Nephi
                                28:30). Small, steady, incremental spiritual improvements
                                are the steps the Lord would have us take. Preparing to walk guiltless
                                before God is one of the primary purposes of mortality and the pursuit
                                of a lifetime; it does not result from sporadic
                                spurts of intense spiritual activity.</big></big></font></big></big></p>

                                assist us to make sustained, paced progress. The example in the Book of
                                Mormon of "many, exceedingly great many" (Alma 13:12) in the ancient
                                Church who were pure and spotless before God is a source of
                                encouragement and comfort to me. I suspect those members of the ancient
                                Church were ordinary men and women just like you
                                and me. These individuals could not look upon sin save it were with
                                abhorrence, and they "were made pure and entered into the rest of the
                                Lord their God" (v. 12). And these principles and
                                this process of spiritual progress apply to each of us equally and
                                always. </big></big></font><font size="-2"><big><big>("Clean Hands and

                                this: No one is more anxious to see us change our lives than the Father
                                and the Savior. In the book of Revelation is a powerful and profound
                                invitation from the Savior. He says, "I stand at the door, and knock:
                                if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him."
                                (Rev. 3:20.) Note that He does not say, "I stand at the
                                door and wait for you to knock." He is calling, beckoning, asking that
                                we simply open our hearts and let Him in.</big></big></font></big></big></p>

                            size="-1"><big><big>In Moroni's great sermon on faith, the principle
                                is even more clearly taught. He was told by the Lord, "If men come unto
                                me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness
                                that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men." It
                                matters not what is our lack or our weakness or our insufficiency. His
                                gifts and powers are sufficient to overcome them all.</big></big></font></big></big></p>

                                many other scriptures. Isaiah said, "He giveth power to the faint; and
                                to them that have no might he increaseth strength." (Isa. 40:29.) Paul
                                was told by the Lord, "My grace is sufficient for
                                thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." (2 Cor. 12:9.) In
                                the Doctrine and Covenants we read, "He that trembleth under my power
                                shall be made strong, and shall bring forth fruits
                                of praise and wisdom." (D&amp;C 52:17; see also 1 Ne. 17:3; 2 Ne. 3:13;

                                dominates the lives of the people it ensnares: (1) This is a major
                                problem
                                that is unbelievably difficult to overcome. &#8230; (2) The most important
                                source of support and strength in the repentance process is the Savior.
                                &#8230; (3) Intense, daily scripture study, regular temple
                                worship, and serious, contemplative participation in the ordinance of
                                the sacrament are all indispensable parts of a true repentance process.
                                This, I assume, is because all of these activities
                                serve to deepen and strengthen one's relationship with the Savior,

                            size="-1"><big><big>There are several interesting things about this
                                scripture. First is that the Lord gives us weaknesses--not sin, but
                                weaknesses--so that we may be humble. Think about that for a moment. If
                                we
                                were perfect in every respect, it would be hard to be humble. Even in
                                specific things, humility comes harder to those who are very strong in
                                one area or another. The woman or man who is
                                remarkably beautiful or handsome can easily become proud of her or his
                                appearance. A brilliant scholar may look down in condescension on those
                                less intellectually blessed. Our weaknesses
                                help us to be humble.</big></big></font></big></big></p>

                                humble ourselves, then, as it says, "my grace is sufficient." In the
                                Bible Dictionary, <em>grace</em> is defined as an "enabling power"
                                (697). Can you see
                                the significance of that promise?</big></big></font></big></big></p>
