                            of
                            the most important events in life are birth and
                            death. And what a thrilling thing it is to be well born, to have goodly
                            parents and live in a godly home! But it may be even more important to
                            die well. . . .</big></font>

                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><big><font size="+1"><big>Sometimes
                            we miss one of our best opportunities--to learn
                            to die well--because we think of death as unpleasant. And because we
                            don't
                            like to think about unpleasant things, we sometimes close our minds and
                            turn away our faces. But death doesn't cease to exist just because it
                            is
                            ignored. The ancient Egyptians had a much more logical way of handling
                            this situation when on their great festive occasions they kept
                            constantly
                            on display before the revelers the skeleton of a dead man. That is,
                            they
                            held up this great image of death before themselves that each one might
                            be continually and constantly reminded that some day he would die.</big></font>
                    </big></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><big><font size="+1"><big>Now
                            I
                            don't want to frighten anyone unduly in this audience
                            this morning, but I would like to point out as gently and as kindly as
                            I can that someday this tremendously important experience of our mortal
                            estate will come to its end. Someone has said that judging by the past
                            there will be very few of us who get out of this world alive. From the
                            very beginning of life, each one of us lives under an irrevocable,
                            unchangeable
                            death sentence, with a guarantee that it will be carried out. The Lord
                            has given us this maximum notice to enable us to adequately prepare for
                            it. And one man indicated this certainty by an inscription on his
                            tombstone
                            saying, "I knew it would happen!" . . .</big></font>
                    </big></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><big><font size="+1"><big>And
                            it
                            has been said that the most important event in
                            life is death. We live to die and then we die to live. Death is a kind
                            of graduation day for life. It is our only means of entrance to our
                            eternal
                            lives. And it seems to me to be a very helpful procedure to spend a
                            little
                            time preliving our death. That is, what kind of person would you like
                            to
                            be when the last hour of your life arrives?</big></font>

                            last hour is the key hour. That is the hour that judges
                            all of the other hours. No one can tell whether or not his life has
                            been
                            successful until his last hour. As Sophocles said, "We must wait till
                            evening
                            to know how pleasant the day has been."</big></font>

                            how righteous, even the Son of God, His chosen prophets--when, despite

                            the omnipotent power were saying, "Now, your faith to the contrary,

                            person has an appointment unto death." (<i>The Teachings of Harold B.

                            lost his
                            daughter, a mother of four or
                            five children, and it was a long fight. I have never seen a father or
                            mother
                            who had greater devotion to a daughter, and as she sank into the
                            shadows
                            the father said, "I guess I failed. If I had faith, she would have
                            gotten
                            well." The Lord said that "those who have faith in me shall be healed
                            if
                            they are not appointed unto death" (see D&amp;C 42:48). That suggests
                            that
                            we are here filling a mission on earth. We can fail in our appointment,
                            but if we live true, then we fulfill our mission. Now, if the Lord asks
                            us, calls us to no greater calling, I ask you, Would any one of you
                            want
                            to remain here one hour more than the Lord wants you to live in
                            mortality,
                            if He had something else for you to do? Not if you are thinking right.
                            You would want to answer the call of the Master, wouldn't you? (<i>The

                            we have tasted its reality it will mean to us birth, deliverance, a new

                            loved one here as death.
                            What is the meaning of death? If death means insensibility to
                            impressions
                            round about us, then, as a matter of truth, we are more insensible and
                            thus more dead than the deceased; for when we say he died, it meant
                            that
                            his spiritual self took flight from his earthly body. It went "home,"
                            in
                            the language of the scriptures, to that God who gave it life. When we
                            shall
                            place in mother earth this afternoon these mortal remains, we're not
                            placing
                            there that which was the living or spiritual part of the deceased; we
                            shall
                            bury only that which was of the earth. The spirit took its flight, and
                            now has been able to view and see and know things far beyond our
                            understanding.
                            As a matter of truth, he is more alive than we are because he is more
                            sensitive
                            to things round about us. I have a firm conviction that the spirits of
                            those who pass on who are righteous have a great influence upon
                            [funeral]
                            services of this kind, bringing to such services through those who
                            perform
                            on the program, if they are in tune therewith, the kind of sweetness of
                            spirit, kindliness of council, forbearance, unselfishness,
                            devotion--all
                            those attributes all come seemingly back in the spirit of him who has
                            passed
                            through those who have been asked to sing and speak. (<i>The Teachings

                            the other side of the veil; and they want men, and they call them. And
                            that was my view in regards to Brother George A. Smith. When he was
                            almost
                            at death's door, Brother Cannon administered to him, and in thirty
                            minutes
                            he was up and ate breakfast with his family. We labored with him in
                            this
                            way, but ultimately, as you know, he died. But it taught me a lesson. I
                            felt that man was wanted behind the veil. We labored also with Brother
                            Pratt; but he, too, was wanted behind the veil. (<i>The Discourses of

                            apostles a
                            short time since. He was about
                            the youngest man in the quorum of the apostles. He was suddenly called
                            away from us. There is a meaning to this. Many times things take place
                            with us that we do not comprehend, unless it is given to us by
                            revelation.
                            But there is a meaning in the loss of that young apostle. I had a

                            evening, as I fell
                            asleep, I was very much
                            troubled with evil spirits that tried to afflict me; and while laboring
                            to throw off these spirits and their influence, there was another
                            spirit
                            visited me that seemed to have power over the evil spirits, and they
                            departed
                            from me. Before he left me he told me not to grieve because of the
                            departure
                            of Abraham Hoagland Cannon; for the Lord had called him to fill another
                            important mission in the spirit world, as a pure and holy apostle from
                            Zion in the Rocky Mountains -- a labor which would not only prove a
                            great
                            benefit to his father's household, but to the Church and kingdom of God
                            on the earth. I feel to name this, because it is true. I have become
                            acquainted
                            with many things in our history that I have marveled at. While in the
                            St.
                            George temple I had a son, who was in the north country, drowned. He
                            had
                            a warning of this. In a dream he was notified how he would die. We had
                            testimony of that after his death. I asked the Lord why he was taken
                            from
                            me. The answer to me was, "You are doing a great deal for the
                            redemption
                            of your dead; but the law of redemption requires some of your own seed
                            in the spirit world to attend to work connected with this." That was a
                            new principle to me; but it satisfied me why he was taken away. I name
                            this, because there are a great many instances like it among the
                            Latter-day
                            Saints. This was the case with Brother Abraham Cannon. He was taken
                            away
                            to fulfil that mission. And where we have anything of this kind, we
                            should
                            leave it in the hands of God to reconcile. (<i>The Discourses of
