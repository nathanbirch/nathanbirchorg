                                    out against that which is intolerable in the sight of the Lord: against
                                    pollution of mind, body, and our surroundings; against vulgarity,
                                    stealing, lying, pride, and blasphemy; against fornication, adultery,
                                    homosexuality, and all other abuses of the sacred power to create;
                                    against murder and all that is like unto it; against all manner of
                                    desecration.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>That such a cry should be necessary among a people so blessed
                                    is amazing to me. And that such things should be found even among the
                                    Saints to some degree is scarcely believable, for these are a people
                                    who are in possession of many gifts of the Spirit, who have knowledge
                                    that puts the eternities into perspective, who have been shown the way
                                    to eternal life.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Sadly, however, we find that to be shown the way is not
                                    necessarily to walk in it, and many have not been able to continue in
                                    faith. These have submitted themselves in one degree or another to the
                                    enticings of Satan and his servants and joined with those of &#8220;the
                                    world&#8221; in lives of ever-deepening idolatry.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>I use the word idolatry intentionally. As I study ancient
                                    scripture, I am more and more convinced that there is significance in
                                    the fact that the commandment &#8220;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&#8221;
                                    is the first of the Ten Commandments.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Few men have ever knowingly and deliberately chosen to reject
                                    God and his blessings. Rather, we learn from the scriptures that
                                    because the exercise of faith has always appeared to be more difficult
                                    than relying on things more immediately at hand, carnal man has tended
                                    to transfer his trust in God to material things. Therefore, in all ages
                                    when men have fallen under the power of Satan and lost the faith, they
                                    have put in its place a hope in the &#8220;arm of flesh&#8221; and in &#8220;gods of
                                    silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor
                                    hear, nor know&#8221; (Dan. 5:23)&#8212;that is, in idols. This I find to be a
                                    dominant theme in the Old Testament. Whatever thing a man sets his
                                    heart and his trust in most is his god; and if his god doesn&#8217;t also
                                    happen to be the true and living God of Israel, that man is laboring in
                                    idolatry.&nbsp; </big></big><br>

                                    stratum of society in which it is operating. But whether man calls it
                                    convention or business, or uses any other euphemism, if it offends

                                    It would include both tangible and less tangible things, and everything
                                    which entices a person away from duty, loyalty, and love for and
                                    service to God.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Idolatry is among the most serious of sins. There are
                                    unfortunately millions today who prostrate themselves before images of
                                    gold and silver and wood and stone and clay. But the idolatry we are
                                    most concerned with here is the conscious worshiping of still other
                                    gods. Some are of metal and plush and chrome, of wood and stone and
                                    fabrics. They are not in the image of God or of man, but are developed
                                    to give man comfort and enjoyment, to satisfy his wants, ambitions,
                                    passions and desires. Some are in no physical form at all, but are
                                    intangible.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Many seem to "worship" on an elemental basis they live to eat
                                    and drink. They are like the children of Israel who, though offered the
                                    great freedoms associated with national development under God's
                                    personal guidance, could not lift their minds above the "flesh pots of
                                    Egypt." They cannot seem to rise above satisfying their bodily
                                    appetites. As Paul put it, their "God is their belly." (Phil. 3:19.)</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Modern idols or false gods can take such forms as clothes,
                                    homes, businesses, machines, automobiles, pleasure boats, and numerous
                                    other material deflectors from the path to godhood. What difference
                                    does it make that the item concerned is not shaped like an idol?
                                    Brigham Young said: "I would as soon see a man worshipping a little god
                                    made of brass or of wood as to see him worshipping his property.*</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Intangible things make just as ready gods. Degrees and
                                    letters and titles can become idols. Many young men decide to attend
                                    college when they should be on missions first. The degree, and the
                                    wealth and the security which come through it, appear so desirable that
                                    the mission takes second place. Some neglect Church service through
                                    their college years, feeling to give preference to the secular training
                                    and ignoring the spiritual covenants they have made.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Many people build and furnish a home and buy the automobile
                                    first&#8212;and then find they "cannot afford" to pay tithing. Whom do they
                                    worship? Certainly not the Lord of heaven and earth, for we serve whom
                                    we love and give first consideration to the object of our affection and
                                    desires. Young married couples who postpone parenthood until their
                                    degrees are attained might be shocked if their expressed preference
                                    were labeled idolatry. Their rationalization gives them degrees at the
                                    expense of children. Is it a justifiable exchange? Whom do they love
                                    and worship&#8212;themselves or God? Other couples, recognizing that life is
                                    not intended primarily for comforts, ease, and luxuries, complete their
                                    educations while they move forward with full lives, having their
                                    children and giving Church and community service.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Many worship the hunt, the fishing trip, the vacation, the
                                    weekend picnics and outings. Others have as their idols the games of
                                    sport, baseball, football, the bullfight, or golf. These pursuits more
                                    often than not interfere with the worship of the Lord and with giving
                                    service to the building up of the kingdom of God. To the participants
                                    this emphasis may not seem serious, yet it indicates where their
                                    allegiance and loyalty are.</big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>Still another image men worship is that of power and
                                    prestige. Many will trample underfoot the spiritual and often the
                                    ethical values in their climb to success. These gods of power, wealth,
                                    and influence are most demanding and are quite as real as the golden
                                    calves of the children of Israel in the wilderness.&nbsp; (Spencer W.
