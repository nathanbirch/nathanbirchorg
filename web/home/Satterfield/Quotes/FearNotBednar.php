                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>Stonewall Jackson was a general in
                            the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. &nbsp;Many military
                            historians consider General Jackson to be one of the most gifted
                            tactical commanders in U.S. history. &nbsp;As a young man he fought in
                            the Mexican American war, and during the Civil War he served with
                            General Robert E. Lee and commanded confederate troops in a number of
                            key battles with Union forces.</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>Once as General Jackson was
                            discussing strategic options with his associates, a commander began his
                            recommendation with the statement, &#8220;I fear we will not find our wagons
                            tonight.&#8221; &nbsp;</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>Stonewall responded to the words,
                            &#8220;I fear,&#8221; in his colleague&#8217;s observation with a penetrating truth that
                            ultimately became the general&#8217;s trademark: &#8220;Never take counsel from
                            your fears&#8221; (Mary Anna Jackson, Memoirs of &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson, 1895,
                            264). &nbsp;That is the simple principle I want to discuss with you
                            today: never taking counsel from your fears.&nbsp; ...<br>
                        </big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>To not take counsel from our fears
                            simply means that we do not permit fear and uncertainty to determine
                            our course in life, to affect negatively our attitudes and behavior, to
                            influence improperly our important decisions, or to divert or distract
                            us from all in this world that is virtuous, lovely, or of good report.
                            &nbsp;To not take counsel from our fears means that faith in the Lord
                            Jesus Christ overrules our fears and that we press forward with a
                            steadfastness in Him. &nbsp;To not take counsel from our fears means
                            that we trust in God&#8217;s guidance, assurance, and timing in our lives.
                            &nbsp;I promise each of us can and will be blessed with direction,
                            protection, and lasting joy as we learn to not take counsel from our
                            fears.</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>As we exercise faith in Christ and
                            trust in His promises, we can walk into the dark with the absolute
                            assurance that our pathway will be illuminated&#8212;at least far enough to
                            take the next step&#8212;and then the next step&#8212;and the next step. &nbsp; One
                            of the great lessons of my life came as I served as the president of
                            BYU&#8211;Idaho and faced significant challenges and obstacles during the
                            transition of Ricks College into a four-year university. &nbsp; I
                            recall listening to President Hinckley on several occasions counsel
                            doubters, cynics, and critics that &#8220;everything will work out.&#8221; &nbsp;
                            And he was right. &nbsp; Everything worked out&#8212;even though we did not
                            know at the time all of the details and specifics.&nbsp; ...<br>
                        </big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>Prophets repeatedly have emphasized
                            the truth that our faith in the Lord can and will replace our fears.</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>Joseph Smith declared, &#8220;We have
                            nothing to fear if we are faithful.&#8221; &nbsp;I want to repeat this simple
                            teaching for emphasis, &#8220;We have nothing to fear if we are faithful&#8221;
                            (Joseph Smith, The Personal Writing of Joseph Smith, 319).</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>President Howard W. Hunter
                            explained, &#8220;If our lives are centered in Christ, nothing can go
                            permanently wrong. &nbsp;I am aware that life presents many challenges,
                            but with the help of the Lord, we need not fear. &nbsp;If our lives and
                            our faith are centered on Jesus Christ and his restored gospel, nothing
                            can ever go permanently wrong. &nbsp;On the other hand, if our lives
                            are not centered on the Savior and his teachings, no other success can
                            ever be permanently right&#8221; (Howard W. Hunter, The Teachings of Howard
                            W. Hunter, edited by Clyde J. Williams, 40).</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>President Gordon B. Hinckley
                            testified, &#8220;We suffer from the fear of ridicule, the fear of failure,
                            the fear of loneliness, the fear of ignorance. &nbsp;Some fear the
                            present, some the future. &nbsp;Some carry a burden of sin and would
                            give almost anything to unshackle themselves from that burden, but fear
                            to change their lives. Let us recognize that fear comes not of God, but
                            rather that this gnawing, destructive element comes from the adversary
                            of truth and righteousness. &nbsp;Fear is the antithesis of faith.
                            &nbsp;It is corrosive in its effects, even deadly.</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>"&#8216;For God hath not given us the
                            spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind&#8217; (<a
                                href="http://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/2-tim/1.7?lang=eng#6"
                                target="_blank" jquery1365022508865="141">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).
                            &nbsp;These principles are the great antidotes to the fears that rob us
                            of our strength and sometimes knock us down to defeat. They give us
                            power. &nbsp;&#8220;What power? The power of the gospel, the power of truth,
                            the power of faith, the power of the priesthood&#8221; (Gordon B. Hinckley,
                            Faith: The Essence of True Religion, 13-14).</big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial;"><big>Our living prophet, President
                            Thomas S. Monson, counseled, &#8220;Though the storm clouds may gather,
                            though the rains may pour down upon us, our knowledge of the gospel and
                            our love of our Heavenly Father and of our Savior will comfort and
                            sustain us and bring joy to our hearts as we walk uprightly and keep
                            the commandments. &nbsp;There will be nothing in this world that can
                            defeat us&#8230;Fear not. &nbsp;Be of good cheer. &nbsp;The future is as
                            bright as your faith&#8221; (&#8220;Be of Good Cheer,&#8221; Ensign, May 2009, 92).<br>
