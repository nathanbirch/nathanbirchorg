                        suit the various capacities of the blessed, is indicated in Christ's
                        teachings. To the apostles He said: "In my Father's house are many
                        mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a
                        place

                        utterance is supplemented by that of Paul, who speaks of graded

                        bodies,
                        and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the
                        glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and
                        another
                        glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star
                        differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of
                        the dead." [1 Cor.

                        knowledge of this subject has been imparted in the present

                        that three
                        great kingdoms or degrees of glory are established, known as the
                        Celestial, the Terrestrial, and the Telestial. Far below the last and
                        least of
                        these, is the state of eternal punishment prepared for the sons of

                            heaven. In the revelation referred to, we read of them</em>: "They are
                        they
                        who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were
                        baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in
                        his
                        name, and this according to the commandment which he has given -- That
                        by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed
                        from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of
                        the hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power; And who
                        overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which
                        the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true. They are
                        they
                        who are the church of the Firstborn. They are they into whose hands the
                        Father has given all things -- -They are they who are priests and
                        kings,
                        who have received of his fulness, and of his glory; And are priests of
                        the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the
                        order of
                        Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son. Wherefore,
                        as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God -- Wherefore, all
                        things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things
                        to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's. * *
                        * These
                        shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.
                        These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the
                        clouds of heaven to reign on the earth over his people. These are they
                        who shall have part in the first resurrection. These are they who shall
                        come forth in the resurrection of the just. * * * These are they who
                        are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new
                        covenant,
                        who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own
                        blood. These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that
                        of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the
                        sun of the firmament is written of as being typical." [D&amp;C 76:50-70]</font></big></big></p>

                        were

                        the moon
                        differs from the sun. These are they who are not valiant in the

                        the glory of

                        some of Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch; But received not
                        the gospel, neither the testimony of Jesus, neither the prophets,

                            their every merit

                            apostles; and Paul adds, "There are also celestial bodies, and bodies
                            terrestrial; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of
                            the
                            terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun and another glory
                            of the moon and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from
                            another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead," (I
                            Corinthians 15:40-42). The Latter-day Saints claim a revelation of the
                            present
                            dispensation as supplementing the scripture just quoted. From this
                            later scripture, (see D&amp;C, Sec. 76), we learn that there are three
                            well-defined degrees in the future state, with numerous, perhaps
                            numberless, gradations. . . . We hold that there is a wide difference
                            between
                            salvation and exaltation; that there are infinite gradations beyond the
                            grave as there are here, and as there were in the state preceding this.

                            very bad, they will get into a terrestrial kingdom, and if there are
                            some that cannot abide a terrestrial law, they may get into a telestial

                        this statement, those who do not comprehend the word of the Lord argue

                        is "worlds without end," yet in time they will get where God was, but
                        he will have gone on to other heights.</font></big></big></p>

                        see how faulty this reasoning is. If in time those who enter the

                        celestial is in now -- then they are in celestial glory, are they not,
                        even if the celestial has advanced? That being the case (I state this
                        for the
                        argument only, for it is not true), then they partake of all the
                        blessings which are now celestial. That means that they become gods,
                        have
                        exaltation, gain the fulness of the Father, and receive a continuation
                        of the "seeds forever." The Lord, however, has said that these
                        blessings,
                        which are celestial blessings, they may never have; they are barred
                        forever!</font></big></big></p>

                        place where the first was, but the first will have moved on and will
                        still be just the same distance in advance of them. This illustration
                        is not true!
                        The wheels do not run on the same track, and do not go in the same

                        Where the Father is these cannot come, for the Lord has said: "Where
