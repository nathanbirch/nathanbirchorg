                            good and evil" in the midst of the garden. (Moses 3:9.) To Adam
                            and Eve the command came: "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest
                            freely eat, But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
                            not
                            eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is
                            given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou
                            eatest thereof
                            thou shalt surely die." (Moses 3:16-17.) <em>Again the account is
                                speaking figuratively</em>. What is meant by partaking of the fruit of

                        his presence, and learned his language. Now if any of you
                        are professors from our schools of language, and have an idea that
                        language came as these theorists say, I am going to tell you that Adam
                        had
                        a perfect language, for he was taught the language of God. That was the
                        first language upon this earth. So much for those theories.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">3. He had no

                        without knowledge of good and evil. He had knowledge, of course. He
                        could speak. He could converse. There were many things he
                        could be taught and was taught; but under the conditions in which he
                        was living at that time it was impossible for him to visualize or
                        understand
                        the power of good and evil. He did not know what pain was. He did not
                        know what sorrow was; and a thousand other things that have come to
                        us in this life that Adam did not know in the Garden of Eden and could
                        not understand and would not have known had he remained there. That
                        was his status before the fall. <small>(<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Thus we
                        learn that the initial creation was paradisiacal; death and mortality
                        had not yet entered the world. There was no mortal flesh upon the
                        earth for any form of life. The Creation was past, but mortality as we
                        know it lay ahead. All things had been created in a state of
                        paradisiacal
                        immortality. It was of this day that Lehi said: "And all things which
                        were created must have remained in the same state in which they were
                        after
                        they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no
                        end." (2 Ne. 2:22.) If there is no death, all things of necessity must
                        continue to live everlastingly and without end.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Continuing
                        the divine commentary about the Creation, we read: "And I, the Lord
                        God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed
                        into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the
                        first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all
                        things were
                        before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to
                        my word." (Moses 3:7.) How filled with meaning are these words! The
                        physical body of Adam is made from the dust of this earth, the very
                        earth to which the Gods came down to form him. His "spirit" enters his
                        body,
                        as Abraham expresses it. (See Abr. 5:7.) Man becomes a living, immortal
                        soul; body and spirit are joined together. He has been created
                        "spiritually," as all things were because there is as yet no mortality.
                        Then comes the Fall; Adam falls; mortality and procreation and death
                        commence. Fallen man is mortal; he has mortal flesh; he is "the first
                        flesh upon the earth." And the effects of his fall pass upon all
                        created
                        things. They fall in that they too become mortal. Death enters the
                        world; mortality reigns; procreation commences; and the Lord's great
                        and
                        eternal purposes roll onward.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Thus, "all
                        things" were created as spirit entities in heaven; then "all things"
                        were created in a paradisiacal state upon the earth; that is,
                        "spiritually
                        were they created," for there was as yet no death. They had <em>spiritual
                            bodies </em>made of the elements of the earth as distinguished from
                        the <em>mortal
                            bodies </em>they would receive after the Fall when death would enter
                        the scheme of things. Natural bodies are subject to the natural death;
                        spiritual
                        bodies, being paradisiacal in nature, are not subject to death. Hence
                        the need for a fall and the mortality and death that grows out of it.</font></big></big></p>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Thus, as
                            the interpolative exposition in the divine word explains, "I, the Lord
                            God, planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there I put the man
                            whom I had formed." (Moses 3:8.) Adam, our father, dwelt in the Garden
                            of Eden. He was the <em>first man of all men </em>in the day of his
                            creation, and
                            he became the <em>first flesh of all flesh </em>through the Fall.
                            Because of the Fall "all things" changed from their spiritual state to
                            a natural state. And
                            thus we read: "And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow
                            every tree, <em>naturally, </em>that is pleasant to the sight of man;
                            and man could
                            behold it. And it became also a living soul. For it was <em>spiritual </em>in
                            the day that I created it." (Moses 3:9; italics added). <small>("Christ

                        of which they both ate, was called the tree of knowledge of good and
                        evil. Why was it thus termed? I will explain a mystery to you,
                        brethren, why this was called so. Adam and Eve, while in the garden of
                        Eden, had not the knowledge you and I have; it is true, they had a
                        degree of intelligence, but they had not the experience, they had not
                        the knowledge by experience, which you and I have: all they knew was
                        barely what they knew when they came there; they knew a commandment had
                        been given to them, and they had sufficient knowledge to name
                        the beasts of the field as they came up before them; but as for the
                        knowledge of good, they had not got it, because they never had anything
                        contrary to good placed before them.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">We will
                        bring up an example. For instance, suppose you had never tasted
                        anything that was sweet--never had the sensation of
                        sweetness--could you have any correct idea of the term sweetness? No.
                        On the other hand, how could you understand bitter if you never had
                        tasted bitterness? Could you define the term to them who had
                        experienced this sensation, or knew it? No. I will bring another
                        example. Take a
                        man who had been perfectly blind from his infancy, and never saw the
                        least gleam of light--could you describe colors to him? No. Would he
                        know anything about red, blue, violet, or yellow? No; you could not
                        describe it to him by any way you might undertake. But by some process
                        let
                        his eyes be opened, and let him gaze upon the sun beams that reflect
                        upon a watery cloud, producing the rainbow, where he would see a
                        variety of colors, he could then appreciate them for himself; but tell
                        him about colors when he is blind, he would not know them from a piece
                        of
                        earthenware. So with Adam previous to partaking of this fruit; good
                        could not be described to him, because he never had experienced the
                        opposite. As to undertaking to explain to him what evil was, you might
                        as well have undertaken to explain, to a being that never had, for one
                        moment, had his eyes closed to the light, what darkness is. The tree of
                        knowledge of good and evil was placed there that man might gain
                        certain information he never could have gained otherwise; by partaking
                        of the forbidden fruit he experienced misery, then he knew that he was
                        once happy, previously he could not comprehend what happiness meant,
                        what good was; but now he knows it by contrast, now he is filled with
                        sorrow and wretchedness, now he sees the difference between his former
                        and present condition, and if by any means he could be restored to
                        his first position, he would be prepared to realize it, like the man
                        that never had seen the light. Let the man to whom all the beauties of
                        light
                        have been displayed, and who has never been in darkness, be in a
                        moment, in the twinkling of an eye, deprived of his natural sight; what
                        a
                        change this would be to him; he never knew anything about darkness
                        before, he never understood the principle at all; it never entered the
                        catalogue of his ideas, until darkness came upon him, and his eye-sight
                        was destroyed: now he can comprehend that the medium he once
                        existed in was light. Now, says he, if I could only regain my sight, I
                        could appreciate it, for I understand the contrast; restore me back
                        again to
                        my sight, and let me enjoy the light I once had; let me gaze upon the
                        works of creation, let me look on the beauties thereof again, and I
                        will be
                        satisfied, and my joy will be full. It was so with Adam; let the way be
                        prepared for his redemption, and the redemption of his posterity, and
                        all
                        creation that groans in pain to be delivered--let them be restored back
                        again to what they lost through the fall, and they will be prepared to
                        appreciate it. <small>(<em>Journal of Discourses </em></small></font></big><big

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">As to the
                        fall, the scriptures set forth that there were in the Garden of Eden
                        two trees. One was the tree of life, which figuratively refers to
                        eternal
                        life; the other was the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which
                        figuratively refers to how and why and in what manner mortality and all
                        that
                        appertains to it came into being. "Of every tree of the garden thou
                        mayest freely eat," the Lord told our first parents, "but of the tree
                        of the
                        knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless,
                        thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but,
                        remember that I
                        forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
                        (Moses 3:16-17.)</font></big></big></p>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Eve
                            partook
                            without full understanding; Adam partook knowing that unless he did so
                            he and Eve could not have children and fulfill the
                            commandment they had received to multiply and replenish the earth.
                            After they had thus complied with whatever the law was that brought
                            mortality into being, the Lord said to Eve: "I will greatly multiply
                            thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring
                            forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall
                            rule over thee." To Adam the decree came: "Cursed shall be the
                            ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy
                            life. Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee." Thus the
                            paradisiacal
                            earth was cursed; thus it fell; and thus it became as it now is.</font></big></big></div>

                        then told that he would surely die, returning through death to the dust
                        whence his physical body had come. And then the Lord said to
                        his Only Begotten: "Behold, the man is become as one of us to know good
                        and evil; and now lest he put forth his hand and partake also of the
                        tree of life and eat and live forever [in his sins!], therefore I, the
                        Lord God, will send him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the
                        ground from
                        whence he was taken." (Moses 4:22-29.) Such is the ancient account of
                        the fall. <small>(<em>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</em>

                                                    may seem very cruel to us without any understanding of all the

                                                    offered to amend the broken law. Adam and Eve did not come here in a
                                                    mortal state. They had to come in the manner in which they did and then
                                                    transgress the law. The transgression of that law, contrary to the view
                                                    of many, was not a sin. It was not a sin any more than the

                                                    substances and creating another entirely different from the first. It
                                                    was not a sin to bring to pass mortality, a condition which was
                                                    essential to the eternal welfare of man. The Fall changed the nature of
                                                    Adam and Eve to fit them for the condition in which we now are. After

                                            It is true, the Lord warned Adam and Eve that to partake of the fruit
                                            they would transgress a law, and this happened. But it is not always a
                                            sin to transgress a law. I will try to illustrate this. The chemist in
                                            his laboratory takes different elements and combines them, and the
                                            result is that something very different results. He has changed the
                                            law. As an example in point: hydrogen, two parts, and oxygen, one part,
                                            passing through an electric spark will combine and form water. Hydrogen
                                            will burn, so will oxygen, but water will put out a fire. This may be
                                            subject to some disagreement by the critics who will say it is not
                                            transgressing a law. Well, Adam's transgression was of a similar
                                            nature, that is, his transgression was in accordance with law.&nbsp; <small>(</small></span></span></big></big><big><span

                                by revelation, we celebrate Eve's act and honor her wisdom and courage
                                in the great episode called the Fall (see Bruce R. McConkie, "Eve and
                                the Fall," in Woman [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979], pp.
                                67-68). Joseph Smith taught that it was not a "sin" because God had
                                decreed
                                it (see The Words of Joseph Smith, ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W.

                                Eve, not the least" (in Journal of Discourses, 13:145). Elder Joseph
                                Fielding Smith said: "I never speak of the part Eve took in this fall
                                as a sin, nor do I accuse Adam of a sin. . . . This was a transgression

                                    suggested contrast between a sin and a transgression reminds us of the
                                    careful wording in the second article of faith: "We believe that men
                                    will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression"
                                    (italics added). It also echoes a familiar distinction in the law. Some
                                    acts,
                                    like murder, are crimes because they are inherently wrong. Other acts,
                                    like operating without a license, are crimes only because they are
                                    legally
                                    prohibited. Under these distinctions, the act that produced the Fall
                                    was not a sin--inherently wrong--but a transgression--wrong because it
                                    was
                                    formally prohibited. These words are not always used to denote
                                    something different, but this distinction seems meaningful in the
                                    circumstances
                                    of the Fall. </font></big></big><big><big><font face="Arial"><small>(<em>Ensign</em>,

                            evil?
                            I can answer this to suit myself by saying it is absolutely necessary,
                            for the simple reason that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if

                                to the decision that every fact that

                                in this world is demonstrated by its opposite</span>. If this is the

                                leads me to the conclusion that the

                                of our first parents was absolutely necessary, that we might be brought

                        Adam brought temporal and spiritual death into the world. Temporal
                        death is the natural death; it occurs when body and spirit
                        separate, thus leaving the body to return to the dust whence it came.
                        Spiritual death is to be cast out of the presence of the Lord and to
                        die as
                        pertaining to the things of righteousness. Adam died spiritually when
                        he was cast out of the heavenly presence found in the garden, and he
                        remained spiritually dead until he repented and was born again through
                        baptism and the receipt of the Holy Spirit. Having thus the
                        companionship of the Holy Ghost, he became alive in Christ and was
                        again guided and directed from on high. He was again in the presence of
                        the Lord. Adam died temporally when his spirit separated from his
                        mortal body. <small>(<em>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith </em>[1985],

                        plan of happiness to fruition, God issued to Adam and Eve the first
                        commandment ever given to mankind. It was a commandment
                        to beget children. A law was explained to them. Should they eat from
                        "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2:17), their
                        bodies
                        would change; mortality and eventual death would come upon them. But
                        partaking of that fruit was prerequisite to their parenthood.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">While I do
                        not fully understand all the biochemistry involved, I do know that
                        their physical bodies did change; blood began to circulate in their
                        bodies. Adam and Eve thereby became mortal. Happily for us, they could
                        also beget children and fulfill the purposes for which the world was
                        created. Happily for them, "the Lord said unto Adam [and Eve26]: Behold
                        I have forgiven thee thy transgression in the Garden of Eden" (Moses
                        6:53). We and all mankind are forever blessed because of Eve's great
                        courage and wisdom. By partaking of the fruit first, she did what
                        needed
                        to be done. Adam was wise enough to do likewise. Accordingly, we could
                        speak of the fall of Adam in terms of a mortal creation, because
                        "Adam fell that men might be" (2 Nephi 2:25).27</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Other
                        blessings came to us through the Fall. It activated two closely coupled
                        additional gifts from God, nearly as precious as life itself--agency
                        and accountability. We became "free to choose liberty and eternal life
                        . . . or to choose captivity and death" (2 Nephi 2:27). Freedom of
                        choice
                        cannot be exercised without accountability for choices made.

                        who first transgressed the limits of Eden in order to initiate the
                        conditions of mortality. Her act, whatever its nature, was formally a
                        transgression but eternally a glorious necessity to open the doorway
                        toward eternal life. Adam showed his wisdom by doing the same. And thus
                        Eve and "Adam fell that men might be" (v. 25).</font></big></big></p>

                        Christians condemn Eve for her act, concluding that she and her
                        daughters are somehow flawed by it. Not the Latter-day Saints! Informed
                        by revelation, we celebrate Eve's act and honor her wisdom and courage
                        in the great episode called the Fall (see Bruce R. McConkie, "Eve and
                        the Fall," in Woman [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1979], pp.
                        67-68). Joseph Smith taught that it was not a "sin" because God had
                        decreed
                        it (see The Words of Joseph Smith, ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W.
                        Cook [Provo: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University,
                        1980], p. 63). Brigham Young declared, "We should never blame Mother
                        Eve, not the least" (in Journal of Discourses, 13:145). Elder Joseph
                        Fielding Smith said: "I never speak of the part Eve took in this fall
                        as a sin, nor do I accuse Adam of a sin. . . . This was a transgression
                        of the
                        law, but not a sin . . . for it was something that Adam and Eve had to
                        do!" (Doctrines of Salvation, comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [Salt

                            between sin and transgression</em></font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">This
                        suggested contrast between a sin and a transgression reminds us of the
                        careful wording in the second article of faith: "We believe that men
                        will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression"
                        (italics added). It also echoes a familiar distinction in the law. Some
                        acts,
                        like murder, are crimes because they are inherently wrong. Other acts,
                        like operating without a license, are crimes only because they are
                        legally
                        prohibited. Under these distinctions, the act that produced the Fall
                        was not a sin--inherently wrong--but a transgression--wrong because it
                        was
                        formally prohibited. These words are not always used to denote
                        something different, but this distinction seems meaningful in the
                        circumstances
                        of the Fall.</font></big></big><br wp="BR2">

                        revelation shows that our first parents understood the necessity of the
                        Fall. Adam declared, "Blessed be the name of God, for because
                        of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have
                        joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God" (Moses 5:10). </font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Note the
                        different perspective and the special wisdom of Eve, who focused on the
                        purpose and effect of the great plan of happiness: "Were it
                        not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never
                        should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the
                        eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient" (Moses 5:11). In
                        his vision of the redemption of the dead, President Joseph F. Smith saw
                        "the
                        great and mighty ones" assembled to meet the Son of God, and among them
                        was "our glorious Mother Eve" (D&amp;C 138:38-39).</font></big></big></p>

                        teaches us correct principles and invites us to govern ourselves. We do
                        this by the choices we make in mortality.</font></big></big></p>

                        day when there are many political, legal, and social pressures for

                        between men and women. Our eternal perspective sets us against changes
                        that alter those separate duties and privileges of men and women
                        that are essential to accomplish the great plan of happiness. We do not
                        oppose all changes in the treatment of men and women, since some
                        changes in laws or customs simply correct old wrongs that were never
                        grounded in eternal principles. <small>(<em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1993,

                        the fullest extent of the penalty of Adam's transgression? I will tell
                        you--it was death. The death of what? The death of the
                        immortal tabernacle--of that tabernacle where the seeds of death had
                        not been, that was wisely framed, and pronounced very good: the seeds
                        of death were introduced into it. How, and in what manner? Some say
                        there was something in the nature of the fruit that introduced
                        mortality. Be this as it may, one thing is certain, death entered into
                        the system; it came there by some means, and sin was the main spring by
                        which this
                        monster was introduced. If there had been no sin, old father Adam would
                        at this day have been in the garden of Eden, as bright and as
                        blooming, as fresh and as fair, as ever, together with his lovely
                        consort Eve, dwelling in all the beauty of youth.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">By one man
                        came death--the death of the body. What becomes of the spirit when the
                        body dies? Will it be perfectly happy? Would old father
                        Adam's spirit have gone back into the presence of God, and dwelt there
                        eternally, enjoying all the felicities and glories of heaven, after his
                        body
                        had died? No; for the penalty of that transgression was not limited to
                        the body alone. When he sinned, it was with both the body and the
                        spirit
                        that he sinned: it was not only the body that eat of the fruit, but the
                        spirit gave the will to eat; the spirit sinned therefore as well as the
                        body; they
                        were agreed in partaking of that fruit. Was not the spirit to suffer
                        then as well as the body? Yes. How long? To all ages of eternity,
                        without any
                        end; while the body was to return back to its mother earth, and there
                        slumber to all eternity. That was the effect of the fall, leaving out
                        the plan
                        of redemption; so that, if there had been no plan of redemption
                        prepared from before the foundation of the world, man would have been
                        subjected to an eternal dissolution of the body and spirit--the one to
                        lie mingling with its mother earth, to all ages of eternity, and the
                        other to be
                        subject, throughout all future duration, to the power that deceived
                        him, and led them astray; to be completely miserable, or, as the Book
                        of
                        Mormon says, "dead as to things pertaining to righteousness;" and I
                        defy any such beings to have any happiness when they are dead as to
                        things pertaining to righteousness. To them, happiness is out of the
                        question; they are completely and eternally miserable, and there is no
                        help
                        for them, laying aside the atonement. That was the penalty pronounced
                        upon father Adam, and upon all the creation of which he was made lord
                        and governor. This is what is termed original sin, and the effect of
                        it. <small>(<em>Journal of Discourses</em> </small></font></big></big><big><big

                            receive the Gospel, a warfare commences immediately; Paul says, "for I
                            delight in the law of God, after the inward man," but I
                            see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and
                            bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
                            members." We have to fight continually, as it were, sword in hand to
                            make the spirit master of the tabernacle, or the flesh subject to the
                            law of the spirit. If this warfare is not diligently prosecuted, then
                            the law of sin prevails, and in consequence of this some apostatize
                            from
                            the truth when crossing the plains, learn to swear instead of to pray,
                            become high-minded and high tempered instead of learning to be
                            patient and humble, and when they arrive in these vallies they feel so
                            self-sufficient that they consider themselves the only ones that are
                            really right; they are filled with darkness, the authority of the
                            Spirit is not listened to, and the law of sin and death is the ruling
                            power in
                            their tabernacles. </font></big></big><big><big><font face="Arial"><small>(<span

                        that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state
                        became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according
                        to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of
                        men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed
                        unto all men that they were lost, because of the transgression of their
                        parents. </font></big></big></p>

                        by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless
                        there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore
                        this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a
                        time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us,
                        which is after the resurrection of the dead.</font></big></big></p>

                        should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life,
                        and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">For behold,
                        if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of
                        life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of
                        God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God
                        would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been
                        frustrated. </font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">But behold,
                        it was appointed unto man to die--therefore, as they were cut off from
                        the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the
                        earth--and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">And now, ye
                        see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and
                        spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they
                        became subjects to follow after their own will.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Now behold,
                        it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal
                        death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Therefore,
                        as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind
                        a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut
                        off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should
                        be reclaimed from this spiritual death.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Therefore,
                        as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this
                        probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a
                        preparatory state.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">And now
                        remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it
                        aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable,
                        being cut off from the presence of the Lord.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">And now,
                        there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had
                        brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Therefore,
                        according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought
                        about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary
                        state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these
                        conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the
                        work of justice.
                        Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease
                        to be God.</font></big></big></p>

                        wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that
                        same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be
                        pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">But, behold,
                        I say unto you that I, the Lord God, gave unto Adam and unto his seed,
                        that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the
                        Lord God, should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and
                        redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">And thus did
                        I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation--that by
