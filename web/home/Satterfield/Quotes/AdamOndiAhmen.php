                                struck our tents and formed
                                a line of march, crossing Grand River at the mouth of Honey Creek and
                                Nelson's
                                Ferry. Grand River is a large, beautiful, deep and rapid stream, during
                                the high waters of Spring, and will undoubtedly admit of navigation by
                                steamboat and other water craft. At the mouth of Honey Creek is a good
                                landing. We pursued our course up the river, mostly through timber, for
                                about eighteen miles, when we arrived at Colonel Lyman Wight's home. He
                                lives at the foot of Tower Hill (a name I gave the place in consequence
                                of the remains of an old Nephite altar or tower that stood thee), where
                                we camped for the Sabbath.</span>

                                        was discovered: President

                                        [i.e.,
                                        Adam-ondi-Ahman], which was about 22 miles from Jackson County,
                                        Missouri,
                                        came across a stone wall in the midst of a dense forest of underbrush.
                                        The wall was 30 feet long, 3 feet thick, and 4 feet high. It was laid
                                        in
                                        mortar or cement. When Joseph visited the place and examined the wall
                                        he
                                        said it was the remains of an altar built by Father Adam and upon which
                                        he offered sacrifices after he was driven from the Garden of Eden. He
                                        said
                                        that the Garden of Eden was located in Jackson County, Missouri. The
                                        whole
                                        town of Adam-ondi-Ahman was in the midst of a thick and heavy forest of
                                        timber and the place was named in honor of Adam's altar. The Prophet
                                        explained
                                        that it was upon this altar where Adam blessed his sons and his
                                        posterity,
                                        prior to his death. (</span><i style="font-family: arial;">BYU Studies</i></small><span

                                    McKay subsequently ordained an apostle and later set apart as a
                                    counselor in the church presidency, offered some interesting
                                    after-thoughts on Far West:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>"In connection with President McKay's visit at Far West, it
                                    is to be noted that while there the President appeared somewhat
                                    overwhelmed. The place made a deep impression upon him; so much so that
                                    he referred to Far West a number of times in the ensuing days as a
                                    place of deep impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>"The feeling that President McKay had at Far West registered
                                    upon me once again, but now with greater impact. The events that
                                    transpired there are significant: (a) The Lord proclaimed Far West a
                                    holy and consecrated land unto him, declaring to Joseph Smith that the
                                    very ground he stood on there was holy. (b) The Prophet Joseph Smith
                                    contended with the devil face to face for some time, upon the occasion
                                    of the power of evil menacing one of his children in the Prophet's home
                                    just west of the temple site. Lucifer declared that Joseph had no right
                                    to be there, that this was his place. Whereupon the Prophet rebuked
                                    Satan in the name of the Lord, and he departed and did not touch the
                                    child again. (c) The overwhelming feeling that President McKay had when
                                    he visited this sacred place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>"The Answer: I have often pondered the holy significance of
                                    Far West, and even more so since President McKay's visit. The
                                    sacredness of Far West, Missouri, is no doubt due to the understanding
                                    that the Prophet Joseph Smith conveyed to the brethren, at these early
                                    times, that Adam-ondi-Ahman, the place to which Adam and Eve fled when
                                    cast out of the Garden of Eden, is where Adam erected an altar unto
                                    God, and offered sacrifices, and that Far West was the spot where Cain
                                    killed Abel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>"This information tends to explain why the Lord declared Far
                                    West to be a holy consecrated place; and no doubt explains why Satan
                                    claimed that place as his own, as it was here that he entered into a
                                    covenant with Cain, resulting in the death of Abel, the first of mortal
                                    existence [to die] upon this earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big><br>
                            <br>
                            <big><big>"It would appear that President McKay while there felt the
                                    spirit and significance of this holy place."&nbsp; (</big><big><span

                                    What is the gospel as taught by Jesus himself? The very first principle
                                    was faith in the Messiah; this was the first principle ever taught to
                                    man.
                                    When Adam, after being driven from the garden of Eden, went to
                                    Adam-ondi-Ahman
                                    to offer sacrifice, the angel of the Lord asked him why he did so. Adam
                                    replied that he did not know, but the Lord
                                    had commanded him to do it. He was then told that the blood of bulls
                                    and
                                    goats, of rams and lambs should be spilt upon the altar as a type of
                                    the
                                    great and last sacrifice which should be offered up for the sins of the
                                    world. The first principle, then, ever taught to Father Adam was faith
                                    in the Messiah, who was to come in the meridian of time to lay down his
                                    life for the redemption of man. (<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</i>,

                                importance to this world. At that time there will be a transfer of
                                authority
                                from the usurper and impostor, Lucifer, to the rightful King, Jesus

                                Judgment will be set and all who have held keys will make their reports
                                and deliver their stewardships, as they shall be required. Adam will
                                direct
                                this judgment, and then he will make his report, as the one holding the
                                keys for this earth, to his Superior Officer, Jesus Christ. Our Lord
                                will
                                then assume the reins of government; directions will be given to the
                                Priesthood;
                                and He, whose right it is to rule, will be installed officially by the
                                voice of the Priesthood there assembled. This grand council of
                                Priesthood
                                will be composed, not only of those who are faithful who now dwell on
                                this
                                earth, but also of the prophets and apostles of old, who have had
                                directing
                                authority. Others may also be there, but if so they will be there by
                                appointment,
                                for this is to be an official council called to attend to the most

                                matters ' concerning the destiny of this earth. (<i>The Way to

                        course. And as this authority has been handed down from one to another
                        in different ages, and in different dispensations, a full reckoning
                        will

                        of their stewardships, and as in the various ages men have received

                        power to administer from those who had previously held the keys
                        thereof,
                        there will be a general account.

                            under the authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                            Saints have to give an account of their transactions to those who
                            direct
                            them in the priesthood; hence the elders give an account to presidents
                            of conferences; and presidents of conferences to presidents of nations.
                            Those presidents and the seventies give an account to the twelve
                            apostles;
                            the twelve to the First Presidency; and they to Joseph, from whom they,
                            and the twelve, received their priesthood. This will include the
                            arrangements
                            of the last dispensation. Joseph delivers his authority to Peter, who
                            held
                            the keys before him, and delivered them to him; and Peter to Moses and
                            Elias, who endowed him with this authority on the Mount; and they to
                            those
                            from whom they received them. And thus the world's affairs will be
                            regulated
                            and put right, the restitution of all things be accomplished, and the
                            kingdom
                            of God be ushered in. The earth will be delivered from under the curse,
                            resume its paradisiacal glory, and all things pertaining to its
                            restoration
                            be fulfilled. [<i>The Gospel Kingdom</i>, p.217]<br>
