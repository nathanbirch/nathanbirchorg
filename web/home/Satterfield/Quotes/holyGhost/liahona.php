                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big><strong></strong>In
                        our day the Book of Mormon is the primary source to which we should
                        turn for help in learning how to invite the constant companionship of
                        the Holy Ghost. The description in the Book of Mormon of the Liahona,
                        the director or compass used by Lehi and his family in their journey in
                        the wilderness, specifically was included in the record as a type and a
                        shadow for our day and as an essential lesson about what we should do
                        to enjoy the blessings of the Holy Ghost.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>As we
                        strive to align our attitudes and actions with righteousness, then the
                        Holy Ghost becomes for us today what the Liahona was for Lehi and his
                        family in their day. The very factors that caused the Liahona to work
                        for Lehi will likewise invite the Holy Ghost into our lives. And the
                        very factors that caused the Liahona not to work anciently will
                        likewise cause us to withdraw ourselves from the Holy Ghost today.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big><strong></strong>As
                        we study and ponder the purposes of the Liahona and the principles by
                        which it operated, I testify that we will receive inspiration suited to
                        our individual and family circumstances and needs. We can and will be
                        blessed with ongoing direction from the Holy Ghost.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The Liahona
                        was prepared by the Lord and given to Lehi and his family after they
                        left Jerusalem and were traveling in the wilderness (see Alma 37:38;
                        D&amp;C 17:1). This compass or director pointed the way that Lehi and
                        his caravan should go (see 1 Nephi 16:10), even "a straight course to
                        the promised land" (Alma 37:44). The pointers in the Liahona operated
                        "according to the faith and diligence and heed" (1 Nephi 16:28) of the
                        travelers and failed to work when family members were contentious,
                        rude, slothful, or forgetful (see 1 Nephi 18:12, 21; Alma 37:41, 43).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The compass
                        also provided a means whereby Lehi and his family could obtain greater
                        "understanding concerning the ways of the Lord" (1 Nephi 16:29). Thus,
                        the primary purposes of the Liahona were to provide both direction and
                        instruction during a long and demanding journey. The director was a
                        physical instrument that served as an outward indicator of their inner
                        spiritual standing before God. It worked according to the principles of
                        faith and diligence.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Just as
                        Lehi was blessed in ancient times, each of us in this day has been
                        given a spiritual compass that can direct and instruct us during our
                        mortal journey. The Holy Ghost was conferred upon you and me as we came
                        out of the world and into the Savior's Church through baptism and
                        confirmation. By the authority of the holy priesthood we were confirmed
                        as members of the Church and admonished to seek for the constant
                        companionship of "the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive,
                        because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he
                        dwelleth with you, and shall be in you" (John 14:17).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>As we each
                        press forward along the pathway of life, we receive direction from the
                        Holy Ghost just as Lehi was directed through the Liahona. "For behold,
                        again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive
                        the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do" (2
                        Nephi 32:5).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The Holy
                        Ghost operates in our lives precisely as the Liahona did for Lehi and
                        his family, according to our faith and diligence and heed.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"Let virtue
                        garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong
                        in the presence of God. . . . </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"The Holy
                        Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging
                        scepter of righteousness and truth<em>" </em>(D&amp;C 121:45-46).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>And the
                        Holy Ghost provides for us today the means whereby we can receive, "by
                        small and simple things" (Alma 37:6), increased understanding about the
                        ways of the Lord: "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
                        Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
                        all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" (John
                        14:26).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The Spirit
                        of the Lord can be our guide and will bless us with direction,
                        instruction, and spiritual protection during our mortal journey. ("That
                        We May Always Have His Spirit To Be With Us," <em>Ensign</em>, May,
