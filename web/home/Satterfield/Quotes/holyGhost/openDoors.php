                        Latter-day Saints have learned the truth that the everlasting gospel
                        has been restored. And what does this knowledge bring to them? It
                        brings to all who have honestly and sincerely obeyed the principles of
                        repentance and baptism the gift of the Holy Ghost, which enlightens
                        their minds, quickens their understanding, and imparts unto them a
                        knowledge of Christ.</big></big></p>

                        Latter-day Saints have a guide, a help, a means to assist in their
                        acquisition of truth, in their desire to know what their duty is, that
                        the world does not possess. And this guide is necessary; man cannot
                        find out truth-he cannot find out God by intellect alone. It has been
                        said that no man can find out God by a microscope. Reason alone is not
                        a sufficient guide in searching for truth. There is another, higher,
                        more sure guide than reason.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>That guide
                        is faith-that principle which draws our spirit into communion with the
                        higher Spirit which will bring all things to our remembrance, show us
                        things to come, and teach us all things. To acquire that Spirit is the
                        responsibility of the Latter-day Saint who would know truth. (<em>Gospel
                            Ideals</em>, p.139)<br>
