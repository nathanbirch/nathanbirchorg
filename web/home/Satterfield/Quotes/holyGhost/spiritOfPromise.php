                        does it mean to be sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise? ... Now, that
                        is the promise which is put into our hearts by the Holy Ghost when we
                        have been sealed because of the kind of life we have lived here, the
                        use we have made of our priesthood, the temple covenants which we have
                        been true to, true to the covenants we made in the waters of baptism.
                        When that is sealed upon us by the Holy Spirit of Promise through the
                        Holy Ghost, then we have a right to eternal life in the celestial
                        kingdom.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The Holy
                        Spirit of Promise is the Holy Ghost, which searches the hearts of men,
                        one who reads our thoughts and our doings, and until He gives His
                        sealing approval, then only will our blessings be efficacious and of
                        full force when we are out of this world. (<em>The Teachings of Harold

                        Spirit of Promise is the Holy Ghost who places the stamp of approval
                        upon every ordinance: baptism, confirmation, ordination, marriage. The
                        promise is that the blessings will be received through faithfulness.</big></big></p>

                        violates a covenant, whether it be of baptism, ordination, marriage or
                        anything else, the Spirit withdraws the stamp of approval, and the
                        blessings will not be received.</big></big></p>

                        ordinance is sealed, with a promise of a reward based upon
                        faithfulness. The Holy Spirit withdraws the stamp of approval where
                        covenants are broken. (<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, 1:45)</big></big><br

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I wish to
                        say a word about the Holy Spirit of Promise, which is the sealing and
                        ratifying power of the Holy Ghost. To have a covenant or ordinance
                        sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise is a compact through which the
                        inherent blessings will be obtained, provided those seeking the
                        blessing are true and faithful (see D&amp;C 76:50-54). ... To have a
                        covenant or ordinance sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise means that
                        the compact is binding on earth and in heaven. ("The Gift of the Holy
                        Ghost--A Sure Compass," <em>Ensign</em>, Apr. 1996, pp. 5-6) </big></big></p>
