                        of the Holy Ghost." Moroni then declares, "And by the power of the Holy

                        Ghost's role in the Godhead, He "<em>witnesses</em> of the Father and
                        the Son" (2 Ne. 31:18; emphasis added), and further He actually <em>glorifies</em>
                        Christ (see John 16:14). Ever relevant, this glorification of our
                        Savior is so vital in the last days, when so many esteem Jesus, the
                        Lord of the Universe, as "naught" (1 Ne. 19:7). Therefore, at the
                        center of the gifts of the Holy Ghost is His unique witnessing to us of
                        Christ's atoning act, history's greatest emancipation: "To some it is
                        given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,
                        and that he was crucified for the sins of the world" (D&amp;C 46:13).
