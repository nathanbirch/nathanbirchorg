                        of Revelation is in connection with these blessings. A person may
                        profit by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation;
                        for instance, when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may
                        give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by noticing it, you may find
                        it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.,) those things that were
                        presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to pass; and
                        thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you may grow
                        into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in Christ
                        Jesus. (<em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, p.151)</big></big><br

                        and sisters and friends, learn this principle. The Lord will increase
                        our knowledge, wisdom, and capacity to obey when we obey His
                        fundamental laws. This is what the Prophet Joseph Smith meant when he
                        said we could have "sudden strokes of ideas" which come into our minds
                        as "pure intelligence." (See <em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>,
                        sel. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, p.
                        151.) This is revelation. We must learn to rely on the Holy Ghost so we
                        can use it to guide our lives and the lives of those for whom we have
                        responsibility. ("A Principle with a Promise," <em>Ensign</em>, May
                        1983, p. 54)</big></big><br style="font-family: arial;" wp="BR2">
