                        the Holy Ghost &#8230; quickens all the intellectual faculties, increases,
                        enlarges, expands and purifies all the natural passions and affections;
                        and adapts them, by the gift of wisdom, to their lawful use. It
                        inspires, develops, cultivates and matures all the fine-toned
                        sympathies, joys, tastes, kindred feelings, and affections of our
                        nature. It inspires virtue, kindness, goodness, tenderness, gentleness,
                        and charity. It develops beauty of person, form and features. It tends
                        to health, vigor, animation, and social feeling. It invigorates all the
                        faculties of the physical and intellectual man. It strengthens, and
                        gives tone to the nerves. In short, it is, as it were, marrow to the
                        bone, joy to the heart, light to the eyes, music to the ears, and life
                        to the whole being. (<em>Key to the Science of Theology</em>, 9th ed.

                        Comforter or Holy Ghost has no other effect than pure intelligence. It
                        is more powerful in expanding the mind, enlightening the understanding,
                        and storing the intellect with present knowledge, of a man who is of
                        the literal seed of Abraham, than one that is a Gentile though it may
                        not have half as much visual effect upon his body; for as the Holy
                        Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of Abraham, it is calm and
                        serene; and his whole soul and body are only exercised by the pure
                        spirit of intelligence; while the effect of the Holy Ghost upon a
                        Gentile, is to purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the
                        seed of Abraham. That man that has none of the blood of Abraham
                        (naturally) must have new creation by the Holy Ghost. (<em>Teachings of
                            the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>, p.149)</big></big></p>

                            is a difference between knowledge and pure intelligence. Satan
                            possesses knowledge, far more than we have, but he has not intelligence
                            or he would render obedience to the principles of truth and right. I
                            know men who have knowledge, who understand the principles of the
                            Gospel, perhaps as well as you do, who are brilliant, but who lack the
                            essential qualification of pure intelligence. They will not accept and
                            render obedience thereto. Pure intelligence comprises not only
                            knowledge, but also the power to properly apply that knowledge (<em>Gospel
                                Doctrine</em>, p.58)</big></big><br>

                            fundamental laws. This is what the Prophet Joseph Smith meant when he
                            said we could have "sudden strokes of ideas" which come into our minds
                            as "pure intelligence." (See <em>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</em>,

                            151.) This is revelation. We must learn to rely on the Holy Ghost so we
                            can use it to guide our lives and the lives of those for whom we have
                            responsibility. ("A Principle with a Promise," <em>Ensign</em>, May

                        of the Holy Ghost than any other association, for they will be led by
                        that Spirit to light and truth and pure intelligence, which can carry
