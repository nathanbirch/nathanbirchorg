                        never has been, and never will be the design and purpose of the
                        Lord-however much we seek him in prayer- to answer all our problems and
                        concerns without struggle and effort on our part. This mortality is a
                        probationary estate. In it we have our agency. We are being tested to
                        see how we will respond in various situations; how we will decide
                        issues; what course we will pursue while we are here walking, not by
                        sight, but by faith. Hence, we are to solve our own problems and then
                        to counsel with the Lord in prayer and receive a spiritual confirmation
                        that our decisions are correct. ("Why the Lord Ordained Prayer," <em>Ensign</em>,
                        Jan. 1976, p. 11)</big></big><br style="font-family: arial;" wp="BR2">

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Because the
                        divine maxim is "nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself" (Moses
                        3:17), we are to learn to choose responsibly, yet in doing this we need
                        help. We also need help regularly. The plan of salvation is designed to
                        facilitate our learning to choose wisely when we opt for righteousness
                        and eternal life instead of misery and death (2 Nephi 2:27).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In the
                        early days of the Church, there were several petitions to the Lord to
                        which He responded in a tutoring manner. On one occasion, the brethren
                        needed a watercraft. The Lord responded that whether they made one or
                        bought one, "it mattereth not to me" (D&amp;C 61:22). It did matter to
                        the Lord that some "take their journey speedily" (D&amp;C 52:7).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In like
                        manner, a question arose as to whether they should go by land or water.
                        The Lord said they should do "according to their judgments" (D&amp;C
                        61:22). A similar divine response was given to the question of whether
                        some of the brethren should go in a group or two by two; they were told
                        this was something for them to determine. On another occasion, as to
                        the direction in which they should proceed, the Lord said whether it
                        was east or west or north or south, it didn't matter; they could not go
                        amiss, because so many opportunities awaited (D&amp;C 80:3).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>These
                        incidents do not suggest any divine indifference whatsoever as to
                        details. Rather, they illustrate how the mentoring of the Lord will
                        surely guide us, but He expects us to use our own minds reliably and to
                        develop them even further in our capacity to choose. Experience,
                        therefore, can be a workhorse way of learning, as we develop our
                        capacity to choose wisely under the influence of the Spirit. (<em>The
                            Promise of Discipleship</em>, pp. 100-101)</big></big><br

                        often left to work out problems, without the dictation or specific
                        direction of the Spirit. That is part of the experience we must have in
                        mortality. Fortunately, we are never out of our Savior's sight, and if
                        our judgment leads us to actions beyond the limits of what is
                        permissible and if we are listening to the still small voice, the Lord
                        will restrain us by the promptings of His Spirit. (Quoted in L. Lionel
                        Kendrick, "Personal Revelation," <em>Ensign</em>, Sept. 1999, p. 10)</big></big><br

                        of revelation. It is a misconception to believe that we should consult
                        Heavenly Father on every matter in life. He expects us to solve a
                        portion of our problems without petitioning Him for potential
                        solutions. It is through this process that we grow, develop, and become
                        more perfect. He is not always concerned about mundane matters unless
                        they are not in keeping with sacred principles. We should daily
                        petition for the companionship of the Holy Ghost. With this presence of
                        the Spirit, we will feel the promptings without petitioning Heavenly
                        Father on every personal matter. ("Personal Revelation," <em>Ensign</em>,
