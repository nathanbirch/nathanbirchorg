                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In
                        highlighting the gift of the Holy Ghost as a distinguishing
                        characteristic of our faith, we need to understand the important
                        differences between (1) the Light of Christ, (2) a manifestation of the
                        Holy Ghost, and (3) the gift of the Holy Ghost.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The Light
                        of Christ, which is sometimes called the Spirit of Christ or the Spirit
                        of God, "giveth light to every man that cometh into the world" (D&amp;C
                        84:46). This is the light "which is in all things, which giveth life to
                        all things" (D&amp;C 88:13). The prophet Mormon taught that "the Spirit
                        of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil"
                        (Moro. 7:16; see also Moro. 7:19; 2 Ne. 2:5; Hel. 14:31). Elder Lorenzo
                        Snow spoke of this light when he said, "Everybody has the Spirit of
                        God" (in Journal of Discourses, 14:304). The Light of Christ enlightens
                        and gives understanding to all men (see D&amp;C 88:11).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In
                        contrast, a manifestation of the Holy Ghost is more focused. This
                        manifestation is given to acquaint sincere seekers with the truth about
                        the Lord and his gospel. For example, the prophet Moroni promises that
                        when we study the Book of Mormon and seek to know whether it is true,
                        sincerely and with real intent, God will "manifest" the truth of it
                        unto us, "by the power of the Holy Ghost" (Moro. 10:4). Moroni also
                        records this promise from the Risen Lord: "He that believeth these
                        things which I have spoken, him will I visit with the manifestations of
                        my Spirit, and he shall know and bear record. For because of my Spirit
                        he shall know that these things are true" (Ether 4:11).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>These
                        manifestations are available to everyone. The Book of Mormon declares
                        that the Savior "manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in him,
                        by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred,
                        tongue, and people" (2 Ne. 26:13).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>To repeat,
                        the Light of Christ is given to all men and women that they may know
                        good from evil; manifestations of the Holy Ghost are given to lead
                        sincere seekers to gospel truths that will persuade them to repentance
                        and baptism.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The gift of
                        the Holy Ghost is more comprehensive. ... The gift of the Holy Ghost
                        includes the right to the constant companionship, that we may "always
                        have his Spirit to be with [us]" (D&amp;C 20:77). ["Always Have His
                        Spirit," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1996, p. 60]<em></em></big></big></p>
