                        have the Holy Ghost. Each one of us who is a member of the Church has
                        had hands laid upon his head and has been given, as far as an ordinance
                        can give it, the gift of the Holy Ghost. But, as I remember, when I was
                        confirmed, the Holy Ghost was not directed to come to me; I was
                        directed to "receive the Holy Ghost." If I receive the Holy Ghost and
                        follow his guidance, I will be among those who are protected and
                        carried through these troubled times. And so will you, and so will
                        every other soul who lives under his direction. If ye are prepared, ye
                        need not fear. ("If Ye Are Prepared Ye Shall Not Fear," <em>Ensign</em>,
                        July 1981, p. 5)</big></big><br style="font-family: arial;" wp="BR1">
