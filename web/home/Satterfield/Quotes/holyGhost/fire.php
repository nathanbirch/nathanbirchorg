                            God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the

                            baptism--yea, by following your Lord and your Savior down into the

                            then can ye speak with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the
                            Holy One of Israel. [Also see Matthew 3:11; Luke 3:16; 3 Nephi 9:20;

                            Filth and disease die in its flames. The baptism of fire, which John
                            promised Christ would bring, means that when men receive the actual
                            companionship of the Holy Spirit, then evil and iniquity are burned out
                            of their souls as though by fire. The sanctifying power of that member
                            of the Godhead makes them clean. In similar imagery, all the fires on
                            all the altars of the past, as they burned the flesh of animals, were
                            signifying that spiritual purification would come by the Holy Ghost,
                            whom the Father would send because of the Son. On that first Pentecost
                            of the so-called Christian Era such fires would have performed their
                            purifying symbolism if the old order had still prevailed. How fitting
                            it was instead for the Lord to choose that very day to send living fire
                            from heaven, as it were, fire that would dwell in the hearts of men and
                            replace forever all the fires on all the altars of the past. And so it
                            was that "when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
                            one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as
                            of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were
                            sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire,
                            and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
                            Ghost." (Acts 2:1-4.) [<em>The Promised Messiah</em>, p.426]</big></big><br

                            promised could not come until they received the Holy Ghost-the baptism
                            of fire-which burns sin and evil out of a human soul as though by fire.

                        the word fire suggests that those who receive this gift with the right
                        heart can expect something more than mere acceptance of certain
                        principles or even baptism by immersion. The use of this expression
                        elsewhere in scripture bears this out. ...</big></big></p>

                            one definition of this expression refers to a cleansing by the Holy
                            Spirit as if by fire, still the scriptures and the writings of the
                            prophets indicate there is something more</u>. </big></big></p>

                        convert who has accepted the gift of the Holy Ghost with the right
                        spirit will experience not only a cleansing <u>but a feeling that will
                            give him a new heart and make of him a new person</u>. Sometimes this
                        is immediate, and sometimes it happens over a period of time. But
                        always there is a change for the better. For the longer-standing member
                        of the Church who has become preoccupied with the world or in little
                        ways has allowed his religious life to be more procedural than of the
                        spirit, there is something to be rediscovered (and for some, discovered
                        for the first time) with the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost. ("Fire
