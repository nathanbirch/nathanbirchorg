                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I have had
                        many interviews with Brother Joseph until the last fifteen or twenty
                        years of my life; I have not seen him for that length of time. But
                        during my travels in the southern country last winter I had many
                        interviews with President Young, and with Heber C. Kimball, and George
                        A. Smith, and Jedediah M. Grant, and many others who are dead. They
                        attended our conference, they attended our meetings. And on one
                        occasion, I saw Brother Brigham and Brother Heber ride in carriage
                        ahead of the carriage in which I rode when I was on my way to attend
                        conference; and they were dressed in the most priestly robes. When we
                        arrived at our destination I asked President Young if he would preach
                        to us. He said, "No, I have finished my testimony in the flesh. I shall
                        not talk to this people any more." "But, said he, "I have come to see
                        you; I have come to watch over you, and to see what the people are
                        doing." Then, said he, "I want you to teach the people-and I want you
                        to follow this counsel yourself- that they must labor and so live as to
                        obtain the Holy Spirit, for without this you cannot build up the
                        kingdom; without the spirit of God you are in danger of walking in the
                        dark, and in danger of failing to accomplish your calling as apostles
                        and as elders in the church and kingdom of God." And, said he, "Brother
                        Joseph taught me this principle." (<em>The Discourses of Wilford
                            Woodruff</em>, p.289)</big></big></p>
