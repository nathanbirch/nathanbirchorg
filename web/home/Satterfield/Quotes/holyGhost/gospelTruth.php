                        received ye spirits which ye could not understand, and received them to
                        be of God; and in this are ye justified?</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>16 Behold
                        ye shall answer this question yourselves; nevertheless, I will be
                        merciful unto you; he that is weak among you hereafter shall be made
                        strong.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>17 Verily I
                        say unto you, he that is ordained of me and sent forth to preach the
                        word of truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doth he preach
                        it by the Spirit of truth or some other way?</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>18 And if
                        it be by some other way it is not of God.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>19 And
                        again, he that receiveth the word of truth, doth he receive it by the
                        Spirit of truth or some other way?</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>20 If it be

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>21
                        Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand and know, that he that
                        receiveth the word by the Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is
                        preached by the Spirit of truth?</big></big></p>

                        another, and both are edified and rejoice together.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>23 And that
                        which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness.</big></big></p>

                        things, without which there is no salvation, can be known only by the
                        power of the Spirit. Paul lays it down as an eternal principle that
                        "the things of God knoweth no man, except he has the Spirit of God."
                        (JST, 1 Corinthians 2:11.) It could not be otherwise, for salvation is
                        found in a spiritual realm-in a different dimension of existence, a
                        realm that is separate and apart and removed from this mortal sphere.
                        Hence, the Spirit of God has the divine commission to teach spiritual
                        truths by conformity to which the saints can qualify to gain the
                        promised spiritual heights. (<em>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</em>,

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The Holy
                        Ghost is the third member of the Godhead, and He is <em>the</em>
                        teacher and witness of all truth. Elder James E. Talmage explained:
                        "The office of the Holy Ghost in His ministrations among men is
                        described in scripture. He is a teacher sent from the Father; and unto
                        those who are entitled to His tuition He will reveal all things
                        necessary for the soul's advancement" (<em>The Articles of Faith,</em>
                        12th ed. [1924], 162). </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>We should
                        always remember that the Holy Ghost is the teacher who, through proper
                        invitation, can enter into a learner's heart. Indeed, you and I have
                        the responsibility to preach the gospel by the Spirit, even the
                        Comforter, as a prerequisite for the learning by faith that can be
                        achieved only by and through the Holy Ghost (see D&amp;C 50:14). In
                        this regard, you and I are much like the long, thin strands of glass
                        used to create the fiber-optic cables through which light signals are
                        transmitted over very long distances. Just as the glass in these cables
                        must be pure to conduct the light efficiently and effectively, so we
                        should become and remain worthy conduits through whom the Spirit of the
                        Lord can operate. </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>But
                        brothers and sisters, we must be careful to remember in our service
                        that we are conduits and channels; we are not the light. "For it is not
                        ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you"
                        (Matthew 10:20). It is never about me and it is never about you. In
                        fact, anything you or I do as an instructor that knowingly and
                        intentionally draws attention to self--in the messages we present, in
                        the methods we use, or in our personal demeanor--is a form of
                        priestcraft that inhibits the teaching effectiveness of the Holy Ghost.
                        "Doth he preach it by the Spirit of truth or some other way? And if it
                        be by some other way it is not of God" (D&amp;C 50:17-18). ["Seek
