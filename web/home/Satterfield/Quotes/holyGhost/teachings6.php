                        consummate reward of integrity is the constant companionship of the
                        Holy Ghost. (See D&amp;C 121:46.) The Holy Ghost does not attend us
                        when we do evil. But when we do what is right, he can dwell with us and
                        guide us in all we do. ("Personal Integrity," <em>Ensign</em>, May
                        1990, p. 33)</big></big></p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In our
                        individual study and classroom instruction, we repeatedly emphasize the
                        importance of recognizing the inspiration and promptings we receive
                        from the Spirit of the Lord. And such an approach is correct and
                        useful. We should seek diligently to recognize and respond to
                        promptings as they come to us. However, an important aspect of baptism
                        by the Spirit may frequently be overlooked in our spiritual development.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>We should
                        also endeavor to discern when we "withdraw [ourselves] from the Spirit
                        of the Lord, that it may have no place in [us] to guide [us] in
                        wisdom's paths that [we] may be blessed, prospered, and preserved"
                        (Mosiah 2:36). Precisely because the promised blessing is <em>that</em>
                        <em>we may always have His Spirit to be with us,</em> we should attend
                        to and learn from the choices and influences that separate us from the
                        Holy Spirit.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The
                        standard is clear. If something we think, see, hear, or do distances us
                        from the Holy Ghost, then we should stop thinking, seeing, hearing, or
                        doing that thing. If that which is intended to entertain, for example,
                        alienates us from the Holy Spirit, then certainly that type of
                        entertainment is not for us. Because the Spirit cannot abide that which
                        is vulgar, crude, or immodest, then clearly such things are not for us.
                        Because we estrange the Spirit of the Lord when we engage in activities
                        we know we should shun, then such things definitely are not for us.
