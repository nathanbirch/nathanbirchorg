                        partaking of the sacrament, we can renew the effects of our baptism.
                        When we desire a remission of our sins through the Atonement of our
                        Savior, we are commanded to repent and come to him with a broken heart
                        and a contrite spirit (see 3 Ne. 9:20; 3 Ne. 12:19; Moro. 6:2; D&amp;C
                        20:37). In the waters of baptism we witness to the Lord that we have
                        repented of our sins and are willing to take his name upon us and serve
                        him to the end (see D&amp;C 20:37). The effects are described by Nephi:
                        "For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by
                        water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy
                        Ghost" (2 Ne. 31:17; see also Moro. 6:4). That last promise is
                        fulfilled as a result of our receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.
