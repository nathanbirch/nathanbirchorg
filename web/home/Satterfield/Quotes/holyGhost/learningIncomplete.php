                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In the
                        latter days, the Lord reaffirmed these basic truths through the Prophet
                        Joseph Smith. In the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, a prayer
                        given by revelation to Joseph Smith, the Prophet prayed: "And do thou
                        grant, Holy Father, that all those who shall worship in this house may
                        be taught words of wisdom &#8230; and that they may seek learning even by
                        study, and also by faith, as thou has said &#8230;"</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>And for
                        what purpose?</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"&#8230; that
                        they may grow up in thee, and receive a fulness of the Holy Ghost, and
                        be organized according to thy laws, and be prepared to obtain every
                        needful thing." (D&amp;C 109:14-15.)</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>This prayer
                        makes it clear that the Lord views one's learning as complete only when
                        one is guided by the Holy Spirit. On another occasion the Lord said,
                        "If ye continue in my word &#8230; ye shall know the truth, and the truth
                        shall make you free." (John 8:31-32.) The truths that can free us from
                        our sins, guilt, false concepts, erroneous understanding, and
                        unproductive habits and behavior are to be had only through the Holy
                        Spirit.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>There has
                        never been a day such as now in all of earthly history when secular
                        learning was so far advanced and widespread as it is today. Yet so many
                        of those around us do not enjoy the truths and the freedom those truths
                        bring of which the Master taught. Rather, to so many people, it seems
                        that truth and true freedom elude their grasp.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The central
                        core of the Father's plan of salvation is that to obtain these truths
                        and the peace, happiness, security, and freedom these truths bring to
                        their righteous adherents, we must draw upon a source of knowledge that
                        lies above and beyond the reach of ordinary learning processes.
