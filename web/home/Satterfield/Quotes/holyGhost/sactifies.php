                        I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were
                        many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on
                        account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their
                        righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work
                        righteousness rather than to perish;</big></big></p>

                        Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were sanctified,

                        they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments
                        made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin
                        save it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great
                        many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their

                        only become spotless and sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost
                        in his personal life. The Holy Ghost is a cleansing and purifying agent
                        to all who receive it and are righteous. This means that sin and
                        iniquity are spiritually burned out of the repentant person. He then
                        receives a remission of sins, and his soul is sanctified and made clean
                        for the Holy Ghost to abide in him. (Conference Report, October 1966,

                        water and of the Spirit includes the receipt of the gift of the Holy
                        Ghost. The Holy Ghost is a sanctifier; he alone, by divine appointment,
                        has power to sanctify a human soul; and the sanctified are those "of
                        the celestial world." (D&amp;C 88:2.) No person enters that glorious
                        kingdom unless and until he is clean and spotless and sanctified. Hence
                        baptism is essential to salvation.&nbsp; ...<br>

                <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><big style="font-family: arial;"><big>To
                            be sanctified is to be saved; to fall short of sanctification is to
                            fail to gain full salvation. Only the sanctified gain eternal life. To
                            be sanctified is to be clean; it is a state of purity and spotlessness
                            in which no taint of sin is found. Only those who die as to sin and are
                            born again to righteousness, becoming thus new creatures of the Holy
                            Ghost, are numbered with the sanctified.</big></big></div>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>It is the
                        work and mission and ministry of the Holy Spirit of God to sanctify the
                        souls of men. This is his assigned labor in the Eternal Godhead. How he
                        does it we do not know, except that it is a work that can only be
                        performed by a spirit being, and hence the need for one of his
                        personality, status, and standing in the Supreme Presidency of the
                        universe.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Baptism of
                        the Spirit is the way and the means whereby sanctification is made
                        available. Thus, Jesus commands all the "ends of the earth" to be
                        baptized in water "that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the
                        Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day." (3
                        Nephi 27:20.) Truly, the Holy Ghost is a anctifier, and the extent to
                        which men receive and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost is the extent to
                        which they aresanctified. In the lives of most of us, sanctification is
                        an ongoing process, and we obtain that glorious status by degrees as we
                        overcome the world and become saints in deed as well as in name. (<em>A
                            New Witness for the Articles of Faith</em>, pp.244, 265-266)</big></big></p>

                        do this by repenting of all our sins and obeying the laws and
                        ordinances of Christ's gospel. As we do this faithfully over our
