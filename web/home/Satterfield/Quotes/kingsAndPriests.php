                                            find that after the days of Noah
                                            an order was introduced
                                            called the patriarchal order, in which every man managed his own family
                                            affairs. And prominent men among them were kings and priests unto God,
                                            and officiated in what is known among us as the priesthood of the Son
                                            of
                                            God, or the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek. Man began again
                                            to multiply on the face of the earth, and the heads of families became
                                            their kings and priests, that is, the fathers of their own people. And
                                            they were more or less under the influence and guidance of the
                                            Almighty.
                                            We read, for instance, in our revelations pertaining to these matters,
                                            of a man called Melchizedek, who was a great high priest. We are told
                                            that
                                            there were a great many high priests in his day, and before him and
                                            after
                                            him; and these men had communication with God, and were taught of him
                                            in
                                            relation to their general proceedings, and acknowledged the hand of God
                                            in all things with which they were associated. <small>(<i>The Gospel

                                Twins landed in Arizona, and the third, a man-child also, was delivered
                                in England, where his birth was heralded on front pages of every
                                newspaper of the realm, for he came to a royal home where town criers
                                announced hourly the progress of the delivery. In pompous ceremony in
                                the great cathedral, this little fellow was given the name of Edward
                                VIII. His father was George V, the crown prince; his grandfather,
                                Edward VII, King of England and Wales and Emperor of India.</span></big></big><br

                                to an earthly kingdom of many centuries duration, and his destiny would
                                bring him to the throne with crown and scepter, under the Divine Right
                                of Kings. Divinely called by the Lord, supposedly, he would not be
                                responsible to his subjects for his governing nor to any human court of
                                appeal. Some thought that such a representative of God "could do no
                                wrong."</span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">As a child, Edward knew
                                that, barring unforeseen circumstances, he would someday sit on the
                                throne, wear a crown and hold a scepter, where now his grandfather,
                                Edward VII, ruled and where later his father, George V, would reign. He
                                learned that, in addition to being King and Emperor, he would also be
                                the head of the Church of England-born to it, not called to it.</span></big></big><br

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">Across the sea in sunny
                                Arizona, the twin boys were born the same day and month and year. The
                                first to come into the world would be called John, and he who came
                                fifteen minutes later would be called Peter. These names,&nbsp;
                                John&nbsp; and Peter, were given them in the sacrament meeting by a
                                proud father. There were no bulletins, no town criers, no hospitals,
                                not even a doctor to deliver them. A midwife, experienced and kindly,
                                assisted in the birth. Few luxuries did this family have. The father
                                was a good, common country farmer and his wife, just a sweet,
                                personable country girl; but both had character, ambition, and
                                intelligence.</span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                their circumstances, and goodly their parents, these twins were born
                                "under the covenant" and were at once princes to heavenly kingdoms
                                under the rule of the divine opportunity for kingship. Heirs they were
                                to the same kind of kingdoms as their father and forefathers Jacob,
                                Isaac, Abraham, Noah, Adam, and numerous others.</span></big></big><br

                                seminary, sacrament meetings, stake conferences, and in their home by
