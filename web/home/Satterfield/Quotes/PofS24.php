                    Another
                    unchanging principle, brothers and sisters, is that of your eventual
                    judgment. Each of you will be judged
                    according to your individual works and the desires of your hearts (see
                    D&amp;C 137:9). You will not be required to pay
                    the debt of any other. Your eventual placement in the celestial,
                    terrestrial, or telestial kingdom will not be determined
                    by chance. The Lord has prescribed unchanging requirements for each.
                    You can know what the scriptures teach, and
                    pattern your lives accordingly (see John 14:2; 1 Cor. 15:40–41; D&amp;C
                    76:50–119; D&amp;C 98:18). [“Constancy amid

                    In
                    all ages, from Adam to this hour, the holy prophets have taught the
                    true doctrine of the judgment. They have
                    always set forth those concepts and verities that would encourage men
                    to live in such a manner as to gain the glorious
                    reward of eternal life when their day and time came to stand before the
                    Eternal Bar. The hour of judgment is not the
                    same for every man. Some are judged at one time and others at a
                    different hour. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are,
                        in fact, many days of
                        judgment available</span>, but always the same Judge sits at the same
                    judgment bar, always the same laws govern the
                    procedures, and always a just and right judgment is imposed.<br>
                    <br>
                    </font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><font

                        birth into mortality is a day
                        of judgment</span> in that it signalizes we were found worthy while in
                    the premortal
                    life to undergo a mortal probation and thus to continue on the course
                    leading to eternal life. There are those who press
                    forward along this course during this mortal probation – with a
                    steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect love of God
                    and of all men, keeping the commandments, and doing only those things
                    that please their Lord – until they are
                    translated and taken up into heaven, or until their calling and
                    election is made sure.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Either
                        of these glorious
                        eventualities is in itself a day of judgment</span>. Their celestial
                    inheritance is thus assured, though they have not yet gained
                    bodies of immortal glory. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Death
                        also is a day of judgment</span> when the spirits of men go to either
                    paradise or hell as their
                    deeds warrant.</font></p>

                    </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The second coming of
                        Christ is the
                        great day of judgment for all men</span>, both the living and the dead.
                    In it those
                    who qualify come forth in the resurrection of the just and obtain their
                    rewards in the kingdoms established for them.
                    At that time the decree goes forth that the rest of the dead shall
                    remain in their graves to await the resurrection of the
                    unjust and their consequent telestial inheritance. At that time the
                    wicked among men are consumed as stubble, their
                    bodies become dust again, and their spirits are consigned to an eternal
                    hell to await the day of the resurrection of
                    damnation. At that time those mortals who are worthy escape the
                    burning, abide the day, and remain on the new earth
                    with its new heavens in the presence of earth’s new King.</font></p>

                    after all men, the sons
                    of perdition included, have risen from death to life and have become
                    immortal – all men will stand before the bar of

                    judgment day is one of the things that really will be. The “future
                    shock” of that judgment and the events to
                    precede it will be without parallel. The dramatic day described so
                    powerfully by Alma will be a highly compressed
                    and collective moment of truth. This will be the day when every knee
                    shall bow and every tongue confess Jesus is
                    the Christ. (Philippians 2:10-11.) No mortals will be standing that
                    day. Those who were cruelly used by the adversary
                    will see that awful reality. Nephi said the unrepentant guilty would
                    “remember [their] awful guilt in perfectness, and
                    be constrained to exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God
                    Almighty – but I know my guilt; I transgressed
                    thy law, and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath obtained
                    me, that I am a prey to his awful misery.” (2
                    Nephi 9:46.) Jesus, who purchased us and who owns us, will require this
                    owning up. They who transgressed divine
                    law will openly admit that their transgressions are their own and
                    cannot be laid at someone else’s door.</font></div>

                    </span>In
                    writing of this event that really will be, the apostle John described
                    how “the kings of the earth, and the great
                    men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men. . .
                    hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of
                    the mountains; And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and
                    hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the
                    throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.” (Revelation 6:15-16.) This is
                    high drama. This is a final confrontation with
                    the ultimate reality, the living God.</font></p>

                    that dramatic day there can be no saving swagger – no panache. On that
                    day there can be no grievance with
                    God that can be advanced at all. In that scene described by John and
                    Alma, those whose grievance with God and his
                    gospel was that his gospel was too plain and too simple will be simply

                    have previously penetrated every

                    music,” and the scriptures are the preserved moral
                    music of the universe that God kept repeating for mankind over the

                    1:20.) All individuals will receive “according to their works,
                    according to the desire of their hearts.” (JS-V 1:9.) The
                    justice and mercy of God will have combined so that by then all
                    inhabitants of the earth will have heard the gospel
                    of Jesus Christ sufficiently to be fully accountable for it. Even those
                    who died without that opportunity will by then
                    have heard the gospel “that they might be judged according to men in
                    the flesh, but live according to God in the
                    spirit.” (JFS-V 1:34, 59.) What President Joseph F. Smith saw was just
                    what Peter saw much earlier when he wrote
                    of the preaching of the gospel “to them that are dead, that they might
                    be judged according to men in the flesh, but
                    live according to God in the spirit.” (1 Peter 4:6.)</font></p>

                    and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words

                    This is made sublimely plain by revelation given in 1832, in which we

                    Apostle Paul taught that the Lord’s teachings and teachers were given
                    that we may all attain “the measure
                    of the stature of the fulness of Christ” (Eph. 4:13). This process
                    requires far more than acquiring knowledge. It is not
                    even enough for us to be <i>convinced</i> of the gospel; we must act
                    and think so that we are <i>converted</i> by it. In contrast
                    to the institutions of the world, which teach us to <i>know</i>

                    their deeds or works or the desires of their hearts. But other
                    scriptures enlarge upon this by referring to our being

                    </span>The
                    prophet Nephi describes the Final Judgment in terms of what we <i>have
                        become</i>: “And if their works have been
                    filthiness they must needs <i>be</i> filthy; and if they <i>be</i><i>is</i>
                    filthy shall be filthy still; and he that <i>is </i>righteous
                    shall be righteous still” (Morm. 9:14; emphasis added; see also Rev.
                    22:11-12; 2 Ne. 9:16; D&amp;C 88:35). The same
                    would be true of “selfish” or “disobedient” or any other personal
                    attribute inconsistent with the requirements of God.
                    Referring to the “state” of the wicked in the Final Judgment, Alma
                    explains that if we are condemned by our words,
                    our works, and our thoughts, “we shall not be found spotless; … and in
                    this awful state we shall not dare to look up
                    to our God” (Alma 12:14). filthy it must needs be that they cannot
                    dwell in the kingdom of
                    God” (1 Ne. 15:33; emphasis added). Moroni declares, “He that </font></p>

                    </span>From
                    such teachings we conclude that the Final Judgment is not just an
                    evaluation of a sum total of good and
                    evil acts – what we have <i>done.</i> It is an acknowledgment of the
                    final effect of our acts and thoughts – what we have
                    <i>become.</i> It is not enough for anyone just to go through the
                    motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants
                    of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some
                    heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is
                    a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us
                    to become. </font></p>

                    </span>A parable illustrates
                    this understanding. A wealthy father knew that if he were to bestow his
                    wealth upon a child
                    who had not yet developed the needed wisdom and stature, the
                    inheritance would probably be wasted. The father said
                    to his child:</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><font

                    </span>“All
                    that I have I desire to give you – not only my wealth, but also my
                    position and standing among men. That
                    which I <i>have</i> I can easily give you, but that which I <i>am</i>
                    you must obtain for yourself. You will qualify for your
                    inheritance by learning what I have learned and by living as I have
                    lived. I will give you the laws and principles by
                    which I have acquired my wisdom and stature. Follow my example,
                    mastering as I have mastered, and you will
                    become as I am, and all that I have will be yours.”</font></p>

                    </span>This
                    parable parallels the pattern of heaven. The gospel of Jesus Christ
                    promises the incomparable inheritance
                    of eternal life, the fulness of the Father, and reveals the laws and
                    principles by which it can be obtained. . . .</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><font

                    </span>The
                    gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan by which we can become what children
                    of God are supposed to become.
                    This spotless and perfected state will result from a steady succession
                    of covenants, ordinances, and actions, an
                    accumulation of right choices, and from continuing repentance. “This
                    life is the time for men to prepare to meet God”
                    (Alma 34:32).</font></p>

                    </span>Now
                    is the time for each of us to work toward our personal conversion,
                    toward becoming what our Heavenly
                    Father desires us to become. As we do so, we should remember that our
                    family relationships -- even more than our
                    Church callings – are the setting in which the most important part of
                    that development can occur. The conversion we
                    must achieve requires us to be a good husband and father or a good wife
                    and mother. Being a successful Church
                    leader is not enough. Exaltation is an eternal family experience, and
                    it is our mortal family experiences that are best
                    suited to prepare us for it. (“The Challenge to Become,” <i>Ensign,</i>

                    disobedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.
                    If these laws and ordinances have been complied with during mortal
                    life, the candidate will be cleansed from the stain
                    of sin by the atoning blood of Jesus Christ and be saved in the

                    happiness or in misery until the time which is
                    appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both

                    God, and be judged according to their works.</font></p>

                    saw these dead as they came to the partial judgment at the coming of
                    Christ. He saw the righteous made
                    happy as they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years, “but the
                    rest of the dead,” after receiving a partial
                    judgment, “lived not again until the thousand years were finished. * *
                    * Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the
                    first resurrection; on such the second death hath no power, but they
                    shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall
                    reign with him a thousand years.” (Rev. 20:5-6.) Then he saw the final
                    judgment, after “Satan shall be loosed out of
                    prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
                    quarters of the earth.” At this judgment the dead,
                    small and great,” shall stand before God, and the books shall be opened
                    out of which all the dead shall be judged.

                    the spirit leaves the body, it returns, says the prophet, immediately
                    to God, to be assigned to its place,
                    either to associate with the good and the noble ones who have lived in
                    the paradise of God, or to be confined in the
                    “prison-house” to await the resurrection of the body from the grave.
                    Therefore we know that Brother Clayton has
                    gone to God, gone to receive the partial judgment of the Almighty which
                    pertains to the period intervening between
                    the death of the body and the resurrection of the body, or the
                    separation of the spirit from the body and their uniting
                    together again. This judgment is passed upon the spirit alone. But
                    there will come a time which will be after the
                    resurrection, when the body and spirit shall be reunited, when the
                    final judgment will be passed on every man.

                    then at the end of that millennial period we will
                    all stand judgment. There is a partial judgment before, but the final

                    lost his chance to inherit the celestial

                    it was a very poor missionary,
                    inadequately prepared, who taught him. Or suppose the individual didn’t

                    One who sins and repents and thereafter fills his life with purposeful

                    sat with a youngster yesterday who is in his early twenties, and he is
                    wondering now, worrying, he is fretting
                    for fear he is not in the niche where he can give the best service. And
                    I said, “Son, all you have to worry about is that
                    you are doing your best in the place where you are today. That is all
                    you have to be concerned about. You are not
                    going to be judged by how you measure to someone else who has achieved
                    a high station in the industrial or financial
                    or religious world. The only measure by which you are going to be
                    measured is, How will you compare with what
                    you had the capacity to do? That is the measure the Lord’s going to
                    measure you by, to see whether or not you have
                    done, to the best of your ability, whatever came within your hands this
                    day, and if you can answer the same honestly
                    day by day. And the only day you have to worry about is today. There is
                    nothing you can do about yesterday except
                    repent. That means if you made mistakes yesterday, don’t be making them
                    today. Don’t worry about tomorrow,
                    because you may have no tomorrows. This is the masterpiece you ought to
                    be thinking about today. And if you can
                    always witness honestly that whatever you did, you did to the best of
                    your ability, and next day try improvement on
                    that, when your life’s end comes, of you it can be said in truth, his
                    was a successful life because he lived to the best
                    that was in him. That’s all the Lord expects of any one of His
                    children. We are all born with different capacities, some
                    to do one thing, some to do the other, and all He asks is that we do
                    our best; and that’s the measure by which we’ll
                    be judged when that time comes.” (<i>The Teachings of

                    which our varied circumstances impose upon us. No wonder we will not
                    complain at the final judgment, especially
                    since even the telestial kingdom’s glory “surpasses all understanding”
                    (D&amp;C 76:89). God delights in blessing us,
                    especially when we realize “joy in that which [we] have desired”
                    (D&amp;C 7:8). [“According to the Desire of [Our]

                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>God
                    judges us not only for our acts, but also for the desires of our
                    hearts. He has said so again and again. This
                    is a challenging reality, but it is not surprising. Agency and
                    accountability are eternal principles. We exercise our free
                    agency not only by what we do, but also by what we decide, or will, or
                    desire. Restrictions on freedom can deprive
                    us of the power to do, but no one can deprive us of the power to will
                    or desire. Accountability must therefore reach
                    and attach consequences to the desires of our hearts.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This
                    principle applies both in a negative way – making us guilty of sin for
                    evil thoughts and desires – and in a
                    positive way – promising us blessings for righteous desires. . . .</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
                    desires of our hearts will be an important consideration in the final
                    judgment. Alma taught that God
                    “granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death
                    or unto life; … according to their wills, whether
                    they be unto salvation or unto destruction. Yea, … he that knoweth good
                    and evil, to him it is given according to his
                    desires.” (Alma 29:4–5.)</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That
                    is a sobering teaching, but it is also a gratifying one. It means that
                    when we have done all that we can, our
                    desires will carry us the rest of the way. It also means that if our
                    desires are right, we can be forgiven for the mistakes
                    we will inevitably make as we try to carry those desires into effect.
                    What a comfort for our feelings of inadequacy!
                    As Alma said:</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“It
                    is requisite with the justice of God that … if their works were good in
                    this life, and the desires of their hearts
                    were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto
                    that which is good. … </font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“If
                    he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end
                    of his days, even so he shall be rewarded
                    unto righteousness.” (Alma 41:3, 5–6.)</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Similarly,
                    in this dispensation the Lord has revealed that he “will judge all men
                    according to their works,
                    according to the desires of their hearts.” (D&amp;C 137:9.) I caution
                    against two possible misunderstandings: First, we
                    must remember that desire is a substitute only when action is truly
                    impossible. If we attempt to use impossibility of
                    action as a cover for our lack of true desire and therefore do not do
                    all that we can to perform the acts that have been
                    commanded, we may deceive ourselves, but we will not deceive the
                    Righteous Judge.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
                    order to serve as a substitute for action, desire cannot be
                    superficial, impulsive, or temporary. It must be
                    heartfelt, through and through. To be efficacious for blessings, the
                    desires of our hearts must be so genuine that they
                    can be called godly.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second,
                    we should not assume that the desires of our hearts can serve as a
                    substitute for an ordinance of the
                    gospel. Consider the words of the Lord in commanding two gospel
                    ordinances: “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
                    a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
                    kingdom of God.” (John 3:5.) And in respect to the
                    three degrees in the celestial glory, modern revelation states, “In
                    order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into
                    this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant
                    of marriage].” (D&amp;C 131:2.) No exception
                    is implied in these commands or authorized elsewhere in the scriptures.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
                    the justice and mercy of God, these rigid commands pertaining to
                    essential ordinances are tempered by divine
                    authorization to perform those ordinances by proxy for those who did
                    not have them performed in this life. Thus, a
                    person in the spirit world who so desires is credited with
                    participating in the ordinance just as if he or she had done
                    so personally. In this manner, through the loving service of living
                    proxies, departed spirits are also rewarded for the
                    desires of their hearts.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
                    summary, under the law of God we are accountable for our feelings and
                    desires as well as our acts. Evil
                    thoughts and desires will be punished. Acts that seem to be good bring
                    blessings only when they are done with real
                    and righteous intent. On the positive side, we will be blessed for the
                    righteous desires of our hearts even though some
                    outside circumstance has made it impossible for us to carry those
                    desires into action.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To
                    paraphrase Paul’s teaching in Romans 2:29, he is a true Latter-day
                    Saint who is one inwardly, whose
                    conversion is that of the spirit, in the heart, whose praise is not of
                    men for outward acts, but of God, for the inward
                    desires of the heart. (“The Desires of Our Hearts,” <i>Ensign</i>,

                    in their conception or expression, our desires profoundly affect the
                    use of our moral agency. Desires
                    thus become real determinants, even when, with pitiful naivete, we do
                    not really want the consequences of our
                    desires.</font></p>

                    denotes a real
                    longing or craving. Hence righteous desires are much more than passive
                    preferences
                    or fleeting feelings. Of course our genes, circumstances, and
                    environments matter very much, and they shape
                    us significantly. Yet there remains an inner zone in which we are
                    sovereign, unless we abdicate. In this zone lies
                    the essence of our individuality and our personal accountability.</font></p>

                    what we
                    insistently desire, over time, is what we will eventually become and
                    what we will receive
                    in eternity. “For I [said the Lord] will judge all men according to
                    their works, according to the desire of their
                    hearts” (D&amp;C 137:9; see also Jer. 17:10). Alma said, “I know that
                    [God] granteth unto men according to their
                    desire, … I know that he allotteth unto men … according to their wills”
                    (Alma 29:4). To reach this equitable end,
                    God’s canopy of mercy is stretched out, including “all that shall die
                    henceforth without a knowledge of [the
                    gospel], who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be

                    D&amp;C 4:3). God can “educate our desires” (see Joseph F. Smith,
                    Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed., Salt Lake City: Deseret
                    Book Co., 1939, p. 297). Others seek to manipulate our desires. But it
                    is we who form the desires, the “thoughts
                    and intents of [our] hearts” (Mosiah 5:13).</font></p>

                        size="+2">The
                    end rule is
                    “according to [our] desires … shall it be done unto [us]” (D&amp;C
                    11:17), “for I, the Lord, will
                    judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of
                    their hearts” (D&amp;C 137:9; see also Alma 41:5;
                    D&amp;C 6:20, 27). One’s individual will thus remains uniquely his. God
                    will not override it nor overwhelm it.
                    Hence we’d better want the consequences of what we want! (“Swallowed Up

                    question reminds us that eventually you (and I) are going to die, be
                    resurrected, be judged, and be awarded
                    a place in eternal realms. (See 1 Cor. 15:22; Alma 12:24; Alma 21:9;
                    Hel. 14:16–17; D&amp;C 138:19.) With each
                    passing sunset, you are closer to that inevitable day of judgment. Then
                    you will be asked to account for your faith,
                    your hopes, and your works. The Lord said:</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Every
                    man may act in doctrine and principle … according to the moral agency
                    which I have given unto him,
                    that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of
                    judgment.” (D&amp;C 101:78; see also Mosiah 3:24.)</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As
                    all will be resurrected, your physical body will then be restored to
                    its proper and perfect frame. (See Alma
                    11:43; Alma 40:23.) The day of your resurrection will be a day of
                    judgment that will determine the kind of life you
                    shall have hereafter.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That
                    judgment will consider not only your actions, but also your innermost
                    intent and heartfelt desires. Your
                    everyday thoughts have not been lost. Scriptures speak of the “bright
                    recollection” (Alma 11:43) and “perfect
                    remembrance” (Alma 5:18) that your mind will provide in times of divine
                    judgment.</font></p>

                    Lord knows the desires of our hearts. At the time of judgment, surely
                    the special yearnings of single sisters
                    and childless couples, for example, will be given compassionate
                    consideration by Him who said:</font></p>

                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When
                    the Lord measures an individual, He does not take a tape measure around
                    the person’s head to determine
                    his mental capacity, nor his chest to determine his manliness, but He
                    measures the heart as an indicator of the
                    person’s capacity and potential to bless others.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why
                    the heart? Because the heart is a synonym for one’s entire makeup. We
                    often use phrases about the heart
                    to describe the total person. Thus, we describe people as being
                    “big-hearted” or “goodhearted” or having a “heart of
                    gold.” Or we speak of people with faint hearts, wise hearts, pure
                    hearts, willing hearts, deceitful hearts, conniving
                    hearts, courageous hearts, cold hearts, hearts of stone, or selfish
                    hearts.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
                    measure of our hearts is the measure of our total performance. As used
                    by the Lord, the “heart” of a person
                    describes his effort to better self, or others, or the conditions he
                    confronts.</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A
                    question I suggest to you is this: How do you measure up? Ultimately
                    you and I will be judged not only for
                    our actions, but also for the desires of our hearts. This truth was
                    revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith at a time when
                    he was shown in vision the celestial kingdom. The revelation is
                    recorded in section 137 of the Doctrine and
                    Covenants. Joseph marveled when he saw his deceased brother Alvin in
                    the celestial kingdom, for Alvin had died
                    before the gospel was restored. Joseph then received this great truth:</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“All
                    who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have
                    received it if they had been permitted
                    to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God; … </font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“For
                    I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to
                    the desire of their hearts.” (D&amp;C
                    137:7, 9.)</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If
                    our works and the desires of our hearts are the ultimate criteria of
                    our character, how do we measure up? What
                    kind of heart should we seek? For what kind of heart should we pray?
                    How should we measure the worth of other
                    people? (“The Measure of Our Hearts,” <i>Ensign</i>, Nov. 1988, p. 15)</font></p>

                    the truth from God’s servants on earth, but to what purpose? It will be
                    impossible to lie to God on judgment day, so
                    the unrepented sins will certainly be revealed then. Far better to

                    while one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other
                    without mercy, the Great Parent
                    of the universe looks upon the whole human family with a fatherly care

                    offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence
                    the children of men, causes “His sun to rise on
                    the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the
                    unjust.” He holds the reins of judgment in His hands;
                    He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the
                    narrow, contracted notions of men, but,
                    “according to the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil,”
                    or whether these deeds were done in
                    England, America, Spain, Turkey, or India. He will judge them, “not
                    according to what they have not, but according
                    to what they have,” those who have lived without law, will be judged
                    without law, and those who have a law, will
                    be judged by that law. We need not doubt the wisdom and intelligence of
                    the Great Jehovah; He will award judgment
                    or mercy to all nations according to their several deserts, their means
                    of obtaining intelligence, the laws by which
                    they are governed, the facilities afforded them of obtaining correct
                    information, and His inscrutable designs in
                    relation to the human family; and when the designs of God shall be made
                    manifest, and the curtain of futurity be
                    withdrawn, we shall all of us eventually have to confess that the Judge
                    of all the earth has done right. (<i>Teachings of

                    justice and mercy of God will have combined so that by then all
                    inhabitants of the earth will have heard the gospel
                    of Jesus Christ sufficiently to be fully accountable for it. Even those

                    spirit." (JFS-V 1:34, 59.) What President Joseph F. Smith saw was just
                    what Peter saw much earlier when he wrote
                    of the preaching of the gospel "to them that are dead, that they might
                    be judged according to men in the flesh, but live

                    many kingdoms there are has not been told to us; they are innumerable.
                    The disciples of Jesus were to dwell
                    with him. Where will the rest go? Into kingdoms prepared for them,
                    where they will live and endure. Jesus will bring
                    forth, by his own redemption, every son and daughter of Adam, except
                    the sons of perdition, who will be cast into
                    hell. Others will suffer the wrath of God -- will suffer all the Lord
                    can demand at their hands, or justice can require
                    of them; and when they have suffered the wrath of God till the utmost
                    farthing is paid, they will be brought out of
                    prison. Is this dangerous doctrine to preach? Some consider it
                    dangerous; but it is true that every person who does
                    not sin away the day of grace, and become an angel to the Devil, will
                    be brought forth to inherit a kingdom of glory.

                    for a kingdom of glory. Therefore he must abide a kingdom which is not
                    a kingdom of glory.</font></p>

                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Recently
                    I had a conversation with a sister who had heard a funeral sermon in
                    which it had seemed to her the
                    doctrine had been taught that is was possible to know what one’s place
                    was to be in the eternal worlds, even before
                    the day of judgment spoken of by John the Revelator when he said he saw
                    the dead, small and great, stand before God
                    to be judged, every man according to the deeds done in the flesh. And
                    then she asked the question: “How is it possible
                    for one to know what the place of an individual is to be before the
                    resurrection takes place?”</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That
                    question suggested some important scriptures. [Alma 41:3-7; D&amp;C
                    88:20-24; and Alma 34:34-35 are
                    quoted.]</font></p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As
                    I pondered those scriptures brought to my attention, as we discussed
                    the question of this sister, these
                    conclusions seemed clear to my mind. In the first place, we are our own
                    judges of the place we shall have in the
                    eternal world. Here and now in mortality, each one of us is having the
                    opportunity of choosing the kind of laws we
                    elect to obey. We are now living and obeying celestial laws that will
                    make us candidates for celestial glory, or we
                    are living terrestrial laws that will make us candidates for either
                    terrestrial glory, or telestial law. The place we shall
                    occupy in the eternal worlds will be determined by the obedience we
                    yield to the laws of these various kingdoms
                    during the time we have here in mortality upon the earth. (<i>Conference

                <p style="text-align: justify; font-family: arial;"><font size="+2"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
                    the final judgment, all the earth children of the Lord will be assigned
                    places in one or the other of the three
                    grand divisions or degrees of salvation, known to us from modern
                    revelation as the three glories. Each assignment
                    will depend upon the use the candidate has made of the opportunities
                    placed before him on earth and elsewhere. “For
                    they shall be judged according to their works” (D. &amp; C. 76: 111).
                    By his own acts each person has shown his fitness
                    to participate in the activities of this or that glory. It would be
                    useless to place him higher than his capabilities would
                    permit, and unfair to place him lower. If placed too high, he would not
                    be competent or happy there, nor could he be
                    content if placed too low. The degree of salvation of necessity
                    corresponds, under the merciful justice of the Lord,
                    with the demonstrated worthiness, capacity, and capability of each
                    individual. The final judgment is individual.

                    while one portion of the human race is judging and condemning the other
                    without mercy, the Great Parent
                    of the universe looks upon the whole human family with a fatherly care
                    and paternal regard; He views them as His
                    offspring, and without any of those contracted feelings that influence
                    the children of men, causes “His sun to rise on
                    the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the
                    unjust.” He holds the reins of judgment in His hands;
                    He is a wise Lawgiver, and will judge all men, not according to the
                    narrow, contracted notions of men, but,
                    “according to the deeds done in the body whether they be good or evil,”
                    or whether these deeds were done in
                    England, America, Spain, Turkey, or India. He will judge them, “not
                    according to what they have not, but according
                    to what they have,” those who have lived without law, will be judged
                    without law, and those who have a law, will
                    be judged by that law. We need not doubt the wisdom and intelligence of
                    the Great Jehovah; He will award judgment
                    or mercy to all nations according to their several deserts, their means
                    of obtaining intelligence, the laws by which
                    they are governed, the facilities afforded them of obtaining correct
                    information, and His inscrutable designs in
                    relation to the human family; and when the designs of God shall be made
                    manifest, and the curtain of futurity be
                    withdrawn, we shall all of us eventually have to confess that the Judge
                    of all the earth has done right. (<i>Teachings of

                    to judge competitively between winners and
                    losers. The Lord’s way of final judgment will be to apply His perfect
                    knowledge of the law a person has received and
                    to judge on the basis of that person’s circumstances, motives, and

                    therewith, and consequently fails to attain what otherwise might have
                    been his eternal gain. The ignorance that thus
                    condemns is responsible ignorance, involving wilful and sinful neglect.
                    Lack of the saving knowledge that one has
                    had no opportunity to acquire is but a temporary deficiency; for
                    Eternal Justice provides means of education beyond

                    acquire. Even the untutored heathen who has lived up to his highest

                    nations be redeemed, and they that knew no law shall have part in the
                    first resurrection; and it shall be tolerable for
                    them.” (D&amp;C 45:54.) [<i>The Vitality of Mormonism</i>, p.278]</font></p>

                    sleep of death, but the spirit lives where the record of his deeds is
                    kept--that does not die--man
                    cannot kill it; there is no decay associated with it, and it still
                    retains in all its vividness the remembrance of that
                    which transpired before the separation by death of the body and the
                    ever-living spirit. Man sleeps for a time in
                    the grave, and by-and-by he rises again from the dead and goes to
                    judgment; and then the secret thoughts of all
                    men are revealed before Him with whom we have to do; we cannot hide
                    them; it would be in vain for a man to
                    say then, I did not do so-and-so; the command would be, Unravel and
                    read the record which he has made of
                    himself, and let it testify in relation to these things, and all could
                    gaze upon it. If a man has acted fraudulently
                    against his neighbor--has committed murder, or adultery, or any thing
                    else, and wants to cover it up, that record
                    will stare him in the face, he tells the story himself, and bears
                    witness against himself. It is written that Jesus will
                    judge not after the sight of the eye, or after the hearing of the ear,
                    but with righteousness shall he judge the poor,
                    and reprove with equity the meek of the earth. It is not because
                    somebody has seen things, or heard anything
                    by which a man will be judged and condemned, but it is because that
                    record that is written by the man himself
                    in the tablets of his own mind--that record that cannot lie--will in
                    that day be unfolded before God and angels,
                    and those who shall sit as judges. (<i>Journal of Discourses</i> 11:70)</font></p>

                    enter into this subject alone, I could show you upon scientific
                    principles that man himself is a
                    self-registering machine, his eyes, his ears, his nose, the touch, the
                    taste, and all the various senses of the body
                    are so many media whereby man lays up for himself a record which
                    perhaps nobody else is acquainted with but
                    himself; and when the time comes for that record to be unfolded, all
                    men that have eyes to see, and ears to hear,
                    will be able to read all things as God himself reads them and

                    both His Old and New World ministries, the Savior commanded, “Be ye
                    therefore perfect.” 10 A footnote
                    explains that the Greek word translated as perfect means “complete,
                    finished, fully developed.” Our Heavenly Father
                    wants us to use this mortal probation to “fully develop” ourselves, to
                    make the most of our talents and abilities. If
                    we do so, when final judgment comes we will experience the joy of
                    standing before our Father in Heaven as
                    “complete” and “finished” sons and daughters, polished by obedience and
                    worthy of the inheritance that He has
                    promised to the faithful. (“The Time to Prepare,” <i>Ensign</i>, May

                    the fundamental reason why the Lord has instructed us to conduct
                    worthiness interviews in His Church
                    is to teach us to keep the commitments we make. In short, we are to be
                    trained during this season of mortal probation
                    to master ourselves, 31 to live with integrity and be true to our
                    covenants. Worthiness interviews are conducted in
                    a spirit of loving concern for each son and daughter of a loving God.
                    These interviews represent the rehearsal stage
                    for final judgment. Such interviews are a blessing, a choice
                    opportunity to account to the Lord through His authorized
                    servants for the sacred stewardship we all have to “watch [ourselves],
                    and [our] thoughts, and [our] words, and [our]
                    deeds.” (“True to the Truth,” <i>Ensign</i>, May 1997, p. 16)</font></p>

                    Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you
                    look forward with an eye of faith,
                    and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption
                    raised in incorruption, to stand before God to
                    be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal

                    know that death is a necessary transition. It will come sooner or later
                    to each of us. Our mortal bodies will
                    return to earth, and our spirits will return to the spirit world. By
                    virtue of the Savior’s atoning sacrifice, we all will
                    be resurrected. Each of us will stand before the judgment bar of the
                    great Jehovah and be rewarded according to our

                    used our mortal probation wisely
                    and its days will give us peace in this life and eternal life in the
                    world to come. (“The Time to Prepare,” <i>Ensign</i>, May
