                                our Heavenly Father placed Adam and Eve on this earth, He did so with
                                the purpose in mind of teaching them how to regain His presence. Our
                                Father promised a Savior to redeem them from their fallen condition. He
                                gave to them the plan of salvation and told them to teach their
                                children faith in Jesus Christ, and repentance. Further, Adam and his
                                posterity were commanded by God to be baptized, to receive the Holy
                                Ghost, and to enter into the order of the Son of God. <i>To enter into
                                    the order of the Son of God is the equivalent today of entering into
                                    the fulness of the Melchizedek Priesthood, which is only received in
                                    the house of the Lord</i>. <br>

                                years before Adam's death, a great event occurred. He took his son
                                Seth, his grandson Enos, and other high priests who were his
                                direct-line descendants, with others of his righteous posterity, into a
                                valley called Adam-ondi-Ahman. There Adam gave to these righteous
                                descendants his last blessing. </big></big></p>

                                Lord then appeared to them. </big></big></p>

                                vast congregation rose up and blessed Adam and called him Michael, the
                                prince and archangel. The Lord himself declared Adam to be a prince
                                forever over his own posterity. </big></big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Then
                                Adam in his aged condition rose up and, being filled with the spirit of
                                prophecy, predicted "whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the
                                [page 9]latest generation." All this is recorded in section 107 of the
                                Doctrine and Covenants (verses 53-56) [D&amp;C 107:53-56]. </big></big></p>

                                which tells us how Adam was able to bring himself and his righteous
                                posterity into God's presence: </big></big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>"The order
                                of this priesthood was confirmed to be handed down from father to son,
                                and tightly belongs to the literal descendants of the chosen seed, to
                                whom the promises were made. </big></big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>"This order
                                was instituted in the days of Adam, and came down by lineage in [order]
                                &#8230; that his posterity should be the chosen of the Lord, and that they
                                should be preserved unto the end of the earth." (D&amp;C 107:40-42;

                        <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>The answer:
                                Adam and his descendants entered into the priesthood order of God.
                                Today we would say they went to the House of the Lord and received
                                their blessings. </big></big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>The order
                                of priesthood spoken of in the scriptures is sometimes referred to as
                                the patriarchal order because it came down from father to son. </big></big></p>
                        <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>But this
                                order is otherwise described in modern revelation as an order of family
                                government where a man and woman enter into a covenant with God--just
                                as did Adam and Eve--to be sealed for eternity, to have posterity, and
                                to do the will and work of God throughout their mortality. </big></big></p>

                                are true to their covenants, they are entitled to the blessing of the
                                highest degree of the celestial kingdom. These covenants today can only
                                be entered into by going to the House of the Lord. </big></big></p>
