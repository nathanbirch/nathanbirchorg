                                            its bearer.&nbsp; A man's name reveals his character.&nbsp; Adam was
                                            able to give names to beast and birds (Gen. 2:20) because, as Milton
                                            says, he understood their nature.&nbsp; This was a concept shared by
                                            the peoples of the ancient world.&nbsp; Hence to know the name of God
                                            is to know God as he has revealed himself.&nbsp; The full disclosure of
                                            his nature and character is given in Jesus Christ, who has manifested
                                            his name (John 17:6, 26).&nbsp; <small>(R. Abba, "Name," in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible</span>,

                        <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><big>When I was called as
                                        an Apostle I went to the scriptures for illumination on my
                                        responsibilities. I found that I was called to be one of the &#8220;special
                                        witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world&#8221; (D&amp;C 107:23). A
                                        witness of Christ I could understand, but why a witness of the name of
                                        Christ?<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Sensitized by this unanswered question, I have been amazed at how often
                                        scriptural teachings on very important subjects refer to the name of
                                        Jesus Christ rather than to the Savior Himself. There is something
                                        important here&#8211;something heretofore rarely discussed in our literature.<br>
                                        &nbsp;<br>
                                        This book is a product of more than a decade of prayerful study and
                                        pondering on the meaning and significance of scriptural references to
                                        the holy name of Jesus Christ. W ith illumination from the Holy Spirit,
                                        it has grown &#8220;line upon line, precept upon precept&#8221; (D&amp;C 98:12),
                                        but even now it only scratches the surface of a subject that is deep
                                        and important. (pp. vii-viii)<br>

                                        The word name occurs in the scriptures about 1500 times, mostly as
                                        references to Deity or to the name of Deity.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Instead of directly referring to God the Father or to His Son, Jesus
                                        Christ, many passages of scripture refer to &#8220;the name of the Lord,&#8221; to
                                        &#8220;his name&#8221; or to &#8220;my name.&#8221;&nbsp; Thus, the scriptures describe praying
                                        as calling upon the name of the
                                        Lord (e.g., Gen. 4:26; D&amp;C 65:4). They teach that miracles are done
                                        by the power of His name (see Acts 4:10; 3 Ne. 8:1). They state that
                                        temples are built to His name (e.g., 1 Chr. 22:19; D&amp;C 109:78).
                                        They declare that salvation and the remission of sins come through His
                                        name or to those who believe on His name (e.g., Acts 10:43; Alma 5:48).
                                        And they declare that there is no other name given whereby man can be
                                        saved (e.g., Acts 4:12; Mosiah 3:17). ...<br>

                                        word name is a word or words by which a person is identified,
                                        designated, or known. Consequently, a scriptural reference to &#8220;name&#8221; of
                                        the Father or the Son can be simply a reference to God Himself...It is
                                        probably not an overstatement to say that this meaning, identification,
                                        is the meaning most readers </big></span></big></big><big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><big>assume for most scriptural references

                                        be referenes to the authority or priesthood or power of Jesus Christ.
                                        Some verses of scripture specifically define "name" in this
                                        manner.&nbsp; The clearest of these is the Lord word to Abraham:
                                        "Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon
                                        thee my name, even the Priesthood of thy father, and my power shall be
                                        over thee. (Abr. 1:18)</span></big></big></big><br>

                                        its bearer.&nbsp; A man's name reveals his character...Hence to know
                                        the name of God is to know God as he has revealed himself (</big></big></span><big><big><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Interpreter's

                                        this reason, in biblical thought a change of name signifies a change of
                                        nature or essence.&nbsp; The dictionary observes:&nbsp; "It could also
                                        be said soberly of anyone that his name </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">is

                                        took place so the he became a new man, he was given a new name" (</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Interpreter's

                                        understanding helps to explain the new names given to many key figures
                                        in the Bible at the time of an important change in their lives.&nbsp;
                                        Examples include Abraham (see Gen. 17:5), Sarah (see Gen. 17:15),

                                        idea that a name changes when a person's essence changes also helps to
                                        explain the scriptural teaching that a new name is given to all persons
                                        who come into the celestial kingdom (see D&amp;C 130:11; see also Isa.

                                        dictionary quoted above concludes:&nbsp; "The uses of the word 'name'
                                        in the OT [Old Testament] are all related to the central conception of
                                        name as denoting essential being.&nbsp; This applies with regard to
                                        both man and God....The name in the OT is the essence of personality,

                                        Today it is a major point of difference between traditional Christians

                                        the Bible scriptures relied upon to support the possibility of

                                        to become "the sons of God" (John 1:12; 1 John 3:1) and his teaching
                                        that "when he shall appear, we shall be like him" (1 John 3:2).&nbsp;
                                        To the same effect is Peter's teaching that Jesus has "given unto us
                                        all things that pertain unto life and godliness" by which "great and
