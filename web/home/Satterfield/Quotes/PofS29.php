                    it is true we teach that a man must comply with these principles of the

                    class that wilfully rejects the atonement of the
                    Savior, for the Lord intends to save all the workmanship of his hands,
                    save these few who will not receive salvation.
                    Our doctrine consigns none others to perdition, but holds forth the

                    They are banished forever from the presence of God because they have

                    perdition, of whom I say that it had been better
                    for them never to have been born; For they are vessels of wrath, doomed
                    to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil
                    and his angels in eternity; Concerning whom I have said there is no
                    forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come
                    -- Having denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having
                    denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father,
                    having crucified him unto themselves and put him to an open shame.</font></p>

                    Perdition – We learn of another class of souls whose sins are such as
                    to place them beyond the
                    present possibility of repentance and salvation. These are called sons
                    of Perdition, children of the fallen angel
                    who was once a Son of the Morning, Lucifer, now Satan, or Perdition.
                    These are they who have violated truth
                    in the light of knowledge; who, having received the testimony of
                    Christ, and having been endowed by the Holy
                    Spirit, then deny the same and defy the power of God, crucifying the
                    Lord afresh and putting Him to an open
                    shame. This, the unpardonable sin, can be committed by those only who
                    have received knowledge and conviction
                    of the truth, against which they then rebel. Their sin is comparable to
                    the treason of Lucifer, by which he sought
                    to usurp the power and glory of his God. Concerning them and their
                    dreadful fate, the Lord has said: “They are
                    they who are the sons of perdition, of whom I say that it had been
                    better for them never to have been born; For
                    they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the
                    devil and his angels in eternity;
                    Concerning whom I have said there is no forgiveness in this world nor
                    in the world to come * * * And the only
                    ones on whom the second death shall have any power; * * * they shall go
                    away into everlasting punishment,
                    which is endless punishment, which is eternal punishment, to reign with
                    the devil and his angels in eternity,
                    where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched, which is
                    their torment -- And the end thereof, neither
                    the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows; Neither was it
                    revealed, neither is, neither will be revealed
                    unto man, except to them who are made partakers thereof; Nevertheless
                    I, the Lord, show it by vision unto many,
                    but straightway shut it up again; Wherefore, the end, the width, the
                    height, the depth, and the misery thereof, they
                    understand not, neither any man except those who are ordained unto this
                    condemnation.”</font></p>

                    doctrines of the Church are explicit in defining the relationship
                    between the mortal probation and the
                    future state, and in teaching individual accountability and the free
                    agency of man. The Church affirms that in
                    view of the responsibility under which every man rests, as the director
                    of his own course, he must be and is free
                    to choose in all things, from the life that leads to the celestial home
                    to the career that is but the introduction to
                    the miseries of perdition. Freedom to worship, or to refuse to worship,
                    is a God-given right, and every soul must
                    abide the result of his choice. (<i>Articles of Faith</i>, pp.410-411)</font></p>

                    name Perdition was given to Lucifer, a son of the morning. He refused
                    to accept the plan proposed by God the Father, for the salvation of His
                    spirit children. For this defiant rebellion he
                    was “thrust down from the presence of God and the Son,” and became
                    Satan or the devil who “maketh war with the
                    saints of God.” Those who do likewise, who follow Satan are called sons
                    of perdition. (Pearl of Great Price, Moses
                    4:1-4). They are they who have known my power, and have been made
                    partakers thereof, and suffered themselves
                    through the power of the devil to be overcome, and to deny the truth
                    and defy my power.” (D. &amp; C. 76:31)</font></p>

                    Lucifer was “an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of
                    God.” He had risen high in
                    knowledge, understanding, and power. He was Lucifer, a son of the
                    morning (of light). For his rebellion there was
                    no excuse. He committed the unpardonable sin, in denying that of which
                    he had full and complete knowledge. He
                    became thereby the father of lies (See D. &amp; C. 76:26, 32-48).</font></p>

                    is probable that only personages who have acquired similar full
                    knowledge, who willfully and deliberately deny
                    the truth, when they know it to be the truth, can commit the
                    unpardonable sin and become sons of perdition. They
                    are sons of perdition because, “Having denied the Holy Spirit after
                    having received it, and having denied the Only
                    Begotten Son of the Father, having crucified him unto themselves and
                    put him to open shame” (D. &amp; C. 76:35). They
                    must have had a fullness of knowledge; a testimony which cannot be
                    destroyed. One must be on a high eminence to
                    fall so low; and few in world’s history have attained such a height. It
                    is doubtful if even Judas, who betrayed Jesus,
                    was sufficiently enlightened to become a son of perdition (Joseph F.
                    Smith, <i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, p. 545). Cain was called
                    Perdition because of his sin, but it is added “for thou wast also
                    before the world,” implying a reason from out of the
                    pre-existent world, for this heavy punishment (Pearl of Great Price,
                    Moses 5:24).</font></p>

                    the expression, sons of perdition, is often used in the scriptures to
                    describe disciples of Satan, all who
                    defy God and teach untruth, and who delight in lies, without
                    necessarily committing the unpardonable sin. The many
                    brethren and sisters who have propounded questions about the sons of
                    perdition may rest secure that with their
                    present knowledge they cannot become sons of perdition.</font></p>

                    to Mormon doctrine, the bodies of all who have had a mortal existence
                    upon earth will be resurrected
                    from the grave. The atonement of Jesus Christ knows no exceptions (Book
                    of Mormon, 3 Nephi 19:22). Yet, after
                    the resurrection comes the judgment. The acts on earth may forfeit many
                    of the possible gifts following earth
                    existence (Ibid., 3 Nephi 26:4, 5). The spiritual redemption, which is
                    part of the redemption from the grave, will
                    apparently be denied the sons of perdition. That appears to be the
                    meaning of the statements that “he [the Lord] saves
                    all except them”; and that they are, “the only ones on whom the second
                    death shall have power (D. &amp; C. 76:38, 43,
                    44). They who will be judged to be sons of perdition will arise from
                    the grave with their bodies, but their bodies will
                    be of no use to them, as the “second death” is meted out to them in the
                    final judgment.</font></p>

                    “everlasting punishment”; they shall “reign with the devil and his
                    angels in eternity.” What this means has not been
                    revealed. The Lord has declared:</font></p>

                    must be a terrible punishment beyond human comprehension, the greatest
                    conceivable, yet a justified
                    punishment. Since the greatest sin is the unpardonable sin, it would
                    appear that they will forfeit all the gains of the
                    ages of pre-existence and the years on earth. It is no wonder that the
                    heavens wept over Lucifer’s rebellion (D. &amp; C.

                    Brigham Young has suggested that the ultimate punishment of the sons of
                    perdition may be that they,
                    having their spiritual bodies disorganized, must start over again must
                    begin anew the long journey of existence,
                    repeating the steps that they took in the eternities before the Great
                    Council was held. That would be punishment,
                    indeed! “They will be decomposed, both soul and body, and return to
                    their native element. I do not say that they will
                    be annihilated; but they will be disorganized, and will be as if they
                    had never been; while we live and retain our
                    identity and contend against those principles which tend to death or
                    dissolution” (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 7:57). “The
                    clay that marred in the potter’s hands was thrown back into the
                    unprepared portion to be prepared over again” (Ibid.,
                    2:124).</font></p>

                    is known of the sons of perdition and their destiny, yet that little
                    known stands as a warning to all men. To
                    deal carelessly with truth, to deny it when once gained, to defy the
                    laws of truth which are the laws of God must be
                    counted among the greatest sins. Those who deal lightly with truth in
                    their lives, though they may not become sons
                    of perdition, must expect a heavy punishment, which often begins in
                    mortality. (<i>Evidences and Reconciliations</i>,
