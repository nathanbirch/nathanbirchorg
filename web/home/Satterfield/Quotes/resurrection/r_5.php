                                        For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he
                                        receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given

                                        universal, infinite, and unconditional. These include His ransom for
                                        Adam&#8217;s original transgression so that no member of the human family is
                                        held responsible for that sin (see Article of Faith 2) Another
                                        universal gift is the Resurrection from the dead of every man, woman,

                                        atoning gift are conditional. They depend on one&#8217;s diligence in keeping
                                        God&#8217;s commandments. For example, while all members of the human family
                                        are freely given a reprieve from Adam&#8217;s sin through no effort of their
                                        own, they are not given a reprieve from their own sins unless they
                                        pledge faith in Christ, repent of those sins, are baptized in His name,
                                        receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and confirmation into Christ&#8217;s
                                        Church, and press forward in faithful endurance the remainder of life&#8217;s
                                        journey. Of this personal challenge, Christ said,</span></big></big><br

                                        Resurrection of the body is a free and universal gift from Christ, a
                                        result of His victory over death, the nature of the resurrected body
                                        (or "degree of glory" given it), as well as the time of one&#8217;s
                                        Resurrection, is affected directly by one&#8217;s faithfulness in this life.
                                        The Apostle Paul made clear, for example, that those fully committed to
                                        Christ will "rise first" (1 Thes. 4:16) in the Resurrection. Modern
                                        revelation clarifies the different orders of resurrected bodies (see
                                        D&amp;C 76:50&#8211;113; compare 1 Corinthians 15:40&#8211;42), promising the
                                        highest degree of glory only to those who adhere to the principles and
                                        ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ (see D&amp;C 76:50&#8211;70; 88:4,
                                        27&#8211;29; 132:21&#8211;24). <small>("The Atonement of Jesus Christ," <span
