                            is supposed by this people that we have all the ordinances in our
                            possession for life and salvation, and exaltation, and that we are
                            administering in these ordinances. This is not the case. We are in
                            possession of all the ordinances that can be administered in the flesh;
                            but there are other ordinances and administrations that must be
                            administered beyond this world. I know you would ask what they are. I
                            will mention one. We have not, neither can we receive here, the
                            ordinance and the keys of the resurrection. They will be given to those
                            who have passed off this stage of action and have received their bodies
                            again, as many have already done and many more will. They will be
                            ordained, by those who hold the keys of the resurrection, to go forth
                            and resurrect the Saints just as we receive the ordinance of baptism,
                            then the keys of authority to baptize others for the remission of their
                            sins. This is one of the ordinances we cannot receive here, and there
                            are many more. We hold the authority to dispose of, alter and change
                            the elements; but we have not received authority to organize native
                            element, to even make a spear of grass grow.<b> </b><small>(<i>Discourses
