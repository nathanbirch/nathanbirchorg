                            wish to call the attention of the congregation to the preaching of the
                            gospel and ministering in behalf of the dead--and will read the first
                            verse of the epistle of Paul in his letter to the Corinthian churches,
                            wherein he is speaking of the subject of the resurrection of the dead
                            and bringing forth sayings, arguments and reasonings in favor of the
                            doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, and explaining how it is that
                            they are to be raised, and using the figure of the sowing of grain;
                            that grain produces its own kind, and whatsoever is sown that is also
                            gathered, whether it be wheat, oats, barley or other grain--every seed
                            of its own kind. So also, in relation to the resurrection of the dead.
                            There will be bodies celestial, bodies terrestrial and bodies
                            telestial. And the glory of one class is as the glory of the sun,
                            another class is as the glory of the moon, and the other class is as
                            the glory of the stars. And as one star differeth from another star in
                            glory, so also will the bodies differ in glory in the resurrection.
                            Those enjoying the celestial spirit, by obeying the celestial laws and
                            are sanctified by that spirit, will be raised celestial bodies. Those
                            who do not abide the celestial law, yet may abide the terrestrial law
                            and sanctified by that spirit, will be raised terrestrial bodies, and
                            those abiding the laws of the telestial, in which there will also be a
                            variety, the lesser and the greater, as is represented by the
                            difference in the brightness of the stars, will be raised telestial
                            bodies, and as each seed bringeth forth its kind, so will each body be
                            quickened by the spirit which has governed and controlled it. And in
                            the order of the resurrection those who are Christ's will be the first
                            fruits of the resurrection and then afterwards they that shall be, or
                            are, Christ's at his coming. And all will be raised in their order,
                            intimating that there is a class which is already fitted and prepared,
                            and these are Christ's, that will be the first fruits of the
                            resurrection, and the other class who are Christ's at His coming. <small>(<i>Collected

                                although the breaking of the bonds of mortal death by the resurrection
                                of the body is a free and universal gift from Christ, a product of his
                                victory over death and the grave, the kind or nature of the body (or
                                "degree of glory" of the body), as well as the time of one's
                                resurrection, is affected very directly by the extent of one's
                                faithfulness in this life. The apostle Paul made clear, for example,
                                that those most fully committed to Christ will "rise first" in the
                                resurrection (1 Thes. 4:16). Paul also speaks of different orders of
                                resurrected bodies (1 Cor. 15:40). The bodies of the highest orders or
                                degrees of glory in the resurrection are promised to those who
                                faithfully adhere to the principles and ordinances of the gospel of
                                Jesus Christ; they will not only enjoy immortality (a universal gift to
                                everyone) but also eternal lives in the Celestial Kingdom of glory
                                (D&amp;C 88:4; 132:24).&nbsp; <small>[</small></big></font></big><small><font

                        may I say that there are comparatively few people in all the world who
                        understand that there will be a resurrection. The Lord has again
                        revealed this in our day. He has impressed it upon us and has given us
                        to understand that when the time comes for that resurrection, if we are
                        worthy that we will be quickened celestial bodies, and from then on, we
                        will dwell in the celestial kingdom, the highest of all kingdoms. But
                        he has taught us also that there are other places where we may go. If
                        we don't want to go to the celestial kingdom, by being less careful and
                        particular about keeping the commandments of God, we may go into the
                        terrestrial kingdom, and if we are still more careless, we may find our
                        way into the telestial kingdom, which is the least of the kingdoms of
                        glory.&nbsp; There are some people who have supposed that if we are
                        quickened telestial bodies that eventually, throughout the ages of
                        eternity, we will continue to progress until we will find our place in
                        the celestial kingdom, but the scriptures and revelations of God have
                        said that those who are quickened telestial bodies cannot come where
                        God and Christ dwell, worlds without end. <small>(Conference Report,

                            degrees of glory. One is known as the Telestial Kingdom. Into this
                            kingdom go those who have lived and have not earned more than the
                            privileges of that kingdom -- a kingdom of glory, it is true, but it is
                            a lesser kingdom. Those who are satisfied with an inheritance in that
                            kingdom, and who live for it, will be resurrected, and they will be
                            quickened, telestial bodies, and will inherit that kingdom. Referring
                            to these the Lord informs us that where God and Christ dwell they can
                            never be.</big></font></big><big> </big><br>

                            Terrestrial Kingdom. The Lord says that those who desire greater
                            blessings and privileges may inherit that kingdom, provided they live
                            for it, and in the resurrection they will be quickened terrestrial
                            bodies, and will inherit the Terrestrial Kingdom.</big></font></big></div>

                            those who desire the highest and best of all, our Heavenly Father has
                            made known that there is another Kingdom, known as the Celestial
                            Kingdom. Those who desire to inherit that kingdom must conform to the
                            rules that are laid down by the Redeemer of mankind while here upon the
                            earth. The virtues that are attained by those in the other kingdoms,
                            will be achieved by those who inherit the Celestial Kingdom, and
                            additional virtues that the others have not acquired will be possessed
                            by those who inherit the Celestial Kingdom.</big></big></div>

                        mercy, in the latter-days, restored the gospel of Jesus Christ, and
                        placed in it divine authority, and then gave understanding to his
                        children that certain ordinances may be received and performed. For
                        this purpose temples were built, and into those temples those who
                        desire a place in the Celestial Kingdom have the authority to go and
                        receive their blessings, to enrich their lives and prepare them for
                        that kingdom. This is the kingdom where God and Christ will dwell. This
                        is the place that those will live, who have earned the right to inherit

                                is the law of evil, carnality, and corruption. Those who so live
                                develop telestial bodies, which can stand telestial glory, which is
                                found in a telestial kingdom. Terrestrial law is the law of decency and
                                uprightness from a worldly standpoint. Those who conform to this higher
                                order thereby create for themselves terrestrial bodies, which in turn
                                can stand terrestrial glory and go to a terrestrial kingdom. Celestial
                                law is the law of the gospel; it is the law of Christ. It calls upon
                                men to forsake the world and rise above every carnal and evil thing. It
                                calls upon men to repent and be baptized and receive the sanctifying
                                power of the Holy Spirit of God. It requires that they become new
                                creatures of the Holy Ghost. Only those who so live acquire thereby
                                celestial bodies; only such bodies can stand celestial glory, and this
                                glory is found only in a celestial kingdom. Since the final destiny of
                                this earth is to become a celestial globe, it thereby becomes the
                                ultimate and highest heaven for all the faithful who have lived on its
                                surface. <small>(<i>The Millennial Messiah</i>, pp. 697-698)</small></big></font></big><big><b><font

                        the time is to come, away in the distant future, when the inhabitants
                        of the earth, all who have dwelt upon it, with the exception of a few
                        who are unredeemable, will be brought to bow the knee willingly; not by
                        compulsion, not by coercion, not by constraint, but willingly bow the
                        knee to King Immanuel and worship God, the true God, the Father, in
                        Christ's holy name, and be willing, perfectly willing, to render
                        obedience to his commandments. Of course, the condition in which they
                        will dwell will be consequent upon their doings when they were in the
                        flesh. They cannot all be in the same class; that is impossible. There
                        is a difference in the degrees of intelligence. Every one of them has
                        his own identity. Every son or daughter of God has a special identity,
                        and that will always be had. We will not all be of the same height or
                        breadth, nor be exactly of the same outward appearance or of features,
                        but every one will be himself, and we will be cultivated and advanced
                        and developed on our own lines. If sinners are only fit, after
                        punishment, to enter into the Telestial world, there will be no end to
                        the progress along telestial lines; but those who thus come forth will
                        be "bodies telestial and not bodies celestial," and there will be
                        progress on every line and kind of being, for that is the order of the
                        universe. Light and truth will come to us as fast as we are willing to
                        receive it and obey it and put it into practice. <small>(Conference

                        size="+1"><big>The Apostle Paul goes on to reason that if Christ was
                        not risen, then we will not rise from the dead; but that if He has been
                        raised from the dead then we also shall be raised; and he goes on to
                        show how universal that resurrection shall be--some to come forth in
                        the resurrection of the just, and some in the resurrection of the
                        unjust, and that there are to be different grades of glory among those
                        that are resurrected. If you want to learn a little more about that, in
                        greater plainness, read the 88th section of the D&amp;C and you will
                        find there something that may be called philosophical as well as
                        theological. Those that obey celestial laws will so improve and purify
                        and sanctify their bodies that those bodies will be fit to come forth
                        in "the first resurrection" to celestial glory, and that they will then
                        be "bodies celestial;" while those who would not receive the laws of
                        God which are celestial, that is, receiving every word that comes from
                        the month of God, but will obey a terrestrial law, will be quickened by
                        a portion of the terrestrial glory and receive of the same in a
                        fullness; and, as we learn also in The Vision, they will not be bodies
                        celestial but "bodies terrestrial," a different class, but raised from
                        the dead and quickened by the power of that vital spirit which
                        quickeneth all things. And they who do not receive the terrestrial laws
                        but only the telestial, will come forth in the resurrection, raised
                        with a telestial body and be quickened by the telestial glory. In the
                        revelation that I referred to, in the 88th section, we learn that they
                        will improve, as all things will have to, for progress is the law of
                        the universe, and all beings, all intelligences will have an
                        opportunity of progressing along certain lines. Those who are of a
                        celestial body shall come forth and have a body like unto the glorious
                        body of the Son of God, and will dwell in His presence and be with Him
                        in glory in the presence of the Father, while those who only obey the
                        terrestrial or the telestial laws, after they are redeemed will come
                        forth in the way that is described, "but where God and Christ
                        dwell"--so it is said of the telestial--"they never can come worlds
                        without end." That may answer some queries that are made in some of our
                        theological classes. <small>(Conference Report, April 1915, p.36)</small></big></font></big></p>

                            salvation, is to secure for ourselves a part in the first resurrection,
                            where we are out of the reach of death, and him that hath the power of
                            it; then we are exalted to thrones, and have power to organize element.
                            Yes, they that are faithful, and that overcome, shall be crowned with
                            crowns of eternal glory. They shall see the time when their cities
                            shall be paved with gold; for there is no end to the precious metals,
                            they are in the native element, and there is an eternity of it. If you
                            want a world of the most precious substance, you will have nothing to
                            do but say the word, and it is done. You can macadamize streets with
                            it, and beautify and make glorious the temples. We can then say to the
                            elements, "Produce ye the best oranges, lemons, apples, figs, grapes,
                            and every other good fruit." I presume we do not draw a single breath
                            that there are not particles of these things mingled in it. But we have
                            not the knowledge now to organize them at our pleasure. Until we have
                            that power we are not fully in possession of the true riches, which is
                            the affirmative of the question, and the negative of the question is no
                            riches at all in reality.<small> (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 1:276)</small></big></font><small>
