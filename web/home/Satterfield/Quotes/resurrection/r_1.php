                            concerning the resurrection, I will merely say that all men will come
                            from the grave as they lie down, whether old or young; there will not
                            be "added unto their stature one cubit," neither taken from it; all
                            will be raised by the power of God, having spirit in their bodies, and
                            not blood. <small>(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, p.199)</small></big></font></big></div>

                        greatest events of history are those which affect the greatest number
                        for the longest periods. By this standard, no event could be more
                        important to individuals or nations than the resurrection of the
                        Master. The eventual resurrection of every soul who has lived and died
                        on earth is a scriptural certainty. And surely there is no event for
                        which one should make more careful preparation.</big></font> </big></p>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><font size="+1"><big>Nothing
                            is more absolutely universal than the Resurrection. Every living being
                            will be resurrected. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all
                            be made alive" (1 Corinthians 15:22). Yes, the resurrection of Jesus
                            Christ is a glorious reality. He became the first fruits of them that
                            slept. He truly rose from the tomb the third day, as He and His
                            prophets foretold, and became, in very deed, "the resurrection and the
                            life" (John 11:25). He broke the bonds of death for all of us. We, too,
                            will be resurrected -- our spirits will be reunited with our bodies. <small>(<i>Teachings
