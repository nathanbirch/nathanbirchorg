                            blood he spilled upon Mount Calvary he did not receive again into his
                            veins. That was poured out, and when he was resurrected, another
                            element took the place of the blood. It will be so with every person
                            who receives a resurrection; the blood will not be resurrected with the
                            body, being designed only to sustain the life of the present
                            organization. When that is dissolved, and we again obtain our bodies by
                            the power of the resurrection, that which we now call the life of the
                            body, and which is formed from the food we eat and the water we drink
                            will be supplanted by another element; for flesh and blood cannot
                            inherit the Kingdom of God. <small>(<i>Discourses of Brigham Young</i>,

                            what is a spiritual body? It is one that is quickened by spirit and not
                            by blood. Our Father in heaven and our Savior and all those who have
                            passed through the resurrection have physical bodies of flesh and
                            bones, but their bodies are quickened by spirit and not by blood, hence
                            they are spiritual bodies and not blood bodies. The immortal body is
                            quickened by spirit, but the mortal body is quickened by blood. The
                            Lord said to Noah, that blood is the life of the body in this mortal
                            sphere. In latter-day revelation we have the following:&nbsp; "For
                            notwithstanding they die, they also shall rise again, a spiritual body.
                            They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which
                            was a natural body [i.e, a mortal body]; even ye shall receive your
                            bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your bodies are
                            quickened."&nbsp; From this we have the Lord's endorsement of a
                            spiritual body being the body which has ceased to be a blood body. Now
                            when Adam was in the Garden of Eden, he was not subject to death. There
                            was no blood in his body and he could have remained there forever. This
                            is true of all the other creations. This statement may not be very
                            pleasing to our evolutionists, but it is true. <small>(<i>Doctrines of

                            In the resurrection from the dead, the bodies which were laid down
                            natural bodies shall come forth spiritual bodies. That is to say, in
                            mortality the life of the body is in the blood, but the body when
                            raised to immortality shall be quickened by the spirit and not the
                            blood. Hence, it becomes spiritual, but it will be composed of flesh
                            and bones, just as the body of Jesus was, who is the prototype. <small>(<i>Doctrines

                        question may be asked, Do not the particles that compose man's body,
                        when returned to mother earth, go to make or compose other bodies? No,
                        they do not. Some philosophers have asserted that human body changes
                        every seven or ten years. This is not correct, for it never changes;
                        that is, the substances of which it is composed do not pass off and
                        other particles of matter come and take their place. Neither can the
                        particles which have comprised the bodies of men become parts of the
                        bodies of other men, or of beasts, fowls, fish, insects or vegetables.
                        They are governed by a divine law, and though they may pass from the
                        knowledge of the scientific world, that divine law still holds and
                        governs and control them. Man's body may be buried in the ocean, it may
                        be eaten by wild beasts, or it may be burned to ashes, and be scattered
                        to the four winds, yet the particles of is composed will not be
                        incorporated into any form of vegetable or animal life, to become a
                        component part of their structure. Are they gross, tangible, and, in
                        their organized capacity, subject to decay and change? Yes, and if
                        buried in the earth, they undergo decomposition and return to mother
                        earth; but it is no matter how minute the particles are, they are
                        watched over and will be preserved until the resurrection and at the
                        sound of the trumpet of God every particle of our physical structures
                        necessary to make our tabernacles perfect will be assembled, to be
                        rejoined with the spirit, every man in his order. Not one particle will
                        be lost. <small>(Deseret News Weekly, 13 October 1875, 581-84; also

                        brings to pass the resurrection of the dead. When the angel who holds

                        twinkling of an eye, and our spirits will take possession of them. We
                        shall then be prepared to dwell with the Father and the Son, and we
