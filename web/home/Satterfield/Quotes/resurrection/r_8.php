                            The assurance of resurrection also gives us a powerful incentive to
                            keep the commandments of God during our mortal lives. Resurrection is
                            much more than merely reuniting a spirit to a body held captive by the
                            grave. We know from the Book of Mormon that the resurrection is a
                            restoration that brings back &#8220;carnal for carnal&#8221; and &#8220;good for that
                            which is good&#8221; (Alma 41:13; see also Alma 41:2-4 and Hel. 14:31). The
                            prophet Amulek taught, &#8220;That same spirit which doth possess your bodies
                            at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have
                            power to possess your body in that eternal world&#8221; (Alma 34:34). As a
                            result, when persons leave this life and go on to the next, &#8220;they who
                            are righteous shall be righteous still&#8221; (2 Ne. 9:16), and &#8220;whatever
                            principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life &#8230; will rise with
                            us in the resurrection&#8221; (D&amp;C 130:18).<br>

                            size="+1"><big>The principle of restoration also means that persons
                            who are not righteous in mortal life will not rise up righteous in the
                            resurrection (see 2 Ne. 9:16; 1 Cor. 15:35-44; D&amp;C 88:27-32).
                            Moreover, unless our mortal sins have been cleansed and blotted out by
                            repentance and forgiveness (see Alma 5:21; 2 Ne. 9:45-46; D&amp;C
                            58:42), we will be resurrected with a &#8220;bright recollection&#8221; (Alma
                            11:43) and a &#8220;perfect knowledge of all of our guilt, and our
                            uncleanness&#8221; (2 Ne. 9:14; see also Alma 5:18). The seriousness of that
                            reality is emphasized by the many scriptures suggesting that the
                            resurrection is followed immediately by the Final Judgment (see 2 Ne.
                            9:15, 22; Mosiah 26:25; Alma 11:43-44; Alma 42:23; Morm. 7:6; Morm.
                            9:13-14). Truly, &#8220;this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God&#8221;
