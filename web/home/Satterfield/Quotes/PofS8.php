                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>I say, the
                        greatest good that could be produced by the all wise Conductor of the
                        universe to His creature, man, was to do just as He has done-bring him
                        forth on
                        the face of the earth, drawing a vail before his eyes. He has caused us
                        to forget every thing we once knew before our spirits entered within
                        this vail of flesh. For instance, it is like this: when we lie down to
                        sleep, our minds are often as bright and active as the mind of an
                        angel, at least they are as active as when our
                        bodies are awake. They will range over the earth, visit distant
                        friends, and, for aught we know, the planets, and accomplish great
                        feats; do that which will
                        enhance our happiness, increase to us every enjoyment of life, and
                        prepare us for celestial glory; but when we wake in the morning, it is
                        all gone from us; we
                        have forgotten it. This illustration will explain in part the nature of
                        the vail which is over the inhabitants of the earth; they have
                        forgotten that they once knew. This is right; were it different, where
                        would be the trial of our faith? In a word, be it so; it is as it
                        should be. (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 1:351-352)</big></big><br

                        existence is conclusive evidence that all who receive it kept their
                        first estate. In our former, or spirit existence, we walked by sight.
                        We were in the
                        presence of both the Father and the Son, and were instructed by them
                        and under their personal presence. In this mortal life, or second
                        estate, the Lord willed that
                        we should walk by faith and not by sight, that we might, with the great
                        gift of free agency, be proved to see if we would do all things
                        whatsoever the Lord our
                        God commanded us. Therefore, he took away from us all knowledge of our
                        spiritual existence and started us out afresh in the form of helpless
                        infants, to grow
                        and learn day by day. In consequence of this we received no former
                        knowledge and wisdom at birth, and, as it is written of the Son of God,
                        who in the
                        beginning made all things, we "received not of the fulness at the
                        first, but received grace for grace." (<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>,

                        To realize a fulness of joy, we had to prove our willingness to keep
                        the commandments

                        been decreed by the Almighty that spirits, upon taking bodies, shall
                        forget all they had known previously, or they could not have a day of
                        trial-could

                        temptation, in unbelief and wickedness, to prove themselves worthy of
                        eternal existence. The
                        greatest gift that God can bestow upon the children of men is the gift
                        of eternal life; that is, to give mankind power to preserve their
                        identity--to preserve

                        among all the human family can comprehend what took place in his first
                        existence? No one, it is blotted from the memory, and I think there is
                        great wisdom manifested in withholding the knowledge of our previous
                        existence. Why? Because we could not, if we had all our pre-existent
                        knowledge
                        accompanying us into this world, show to our Father in the heavens and
                        to the heavenly host that we would be in all things obedient; in other
                        words, we could
                        not be tried as the Lord designs to try us here in this state of
                        existence, to qualify us for a higher state hereafter. In order to try
                        the children of men, there must be
                        a degree of knowledge withheld from them, for it would be no temptation
                        to them if they could understand from the beginning the consequences of
                        their acts,
                        and the nature and results of this and that temptation. But in order
                        that we may prove ourselves before the heavens obedient and faithful in
                        all things, we have to
                        begin at the very first principles of knowledge, and be tried from
                        knowledge to knowledge, and from grace to grace, until, like our elder

                        overcome and triumph over all our imperfections, and receive with him
                        the same glory that he inherits, which glory he had before the world

                        followed his Head; that where he is, we may be also; and being with
                        him, may be like him. If Christ knew beforehand, so did we. But in
                        coming here, we forgot
                        all, that our agency might be free indeed, to choose good or evil, that
                        we might merit the reward of our own choice and conduct. But by the
                        power of the Spirit,
                        in the redemption of Christ, through obedience, we often catch a spark
                        from the awakened memories of the immortal soul, which lights up our
                        whole being as
                        with the glory of our former home. (<em>Gospel Doctrine</em>, p.13)</big></big><br

                        memory of
                        our premortal experiences was suspended. In the Garden of Eden, God

                        between the

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>We define
                        the veil as the border between mortality and eternity; it is also a
                        film of forgetting which covers the memories of earlier experiences.
                        This
                        forgetfulness will be lifted one day, and on that day we will see
                        forever--rather than "through a glass darkly" (1 Cor. 13:12).</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>There are
                        poignant and frequent reminders of the veil, adding to our sense of
                        being close but still outside. In our deepest prayers, when the agency
                        of man
                        encounters the omniscience of God, we sometimes sense, if only
                        momentarily, how very provincial our petitions really are; we perceive
                        that there are more
                        good answers than we have good questions; and we realize that we have
                        been taught more than we can tell, for the language used is not that
                        which tongue can
                        transmit.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>We
                        experience this same close separateness when a baby is born, but also
                        as we wait with those who are dying--for then we brush against the
                        veil, as goodbyes
                        and greetings are said--almost within earshot of each other! In such
                        moments, this resonance with realities on the other side of the veil is
                        so real it can he
                        explained in only one way!</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>No wonder
                        the Savior said that his doctrines would be recognized by his sheep,
                        that we would know his voice, that we would follow him (see John
                        10:14). We
                        do not, therefore, follow strangers. Deep within us, his doctrines do
                        strike the promised chord of familiarity and underscore our true
                        identity. Our sense of
                        belonging grows in spite of our sense of separateness, for his
                        teachings stir our souls awakening feelings within us which have
                        somehow survived underneath
                        the encrusting experiences of mortality.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>This inner
                        serenity which the believer knows as he brushes against the veil is
                        cousin to certitude. The peace it brings surpasses our understanding
                        and certainly
                        our capacity to explain. But it requires a patience which stands in
                        stark contrast to the restlessness of the world in which, said Isaiah,
                        the wicked are like the
                        pounding and troubled sea which cannot rest (see Isa. 57:20).</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>But
                        mercifully the veil is there! It is fixed by the wisdom of God for our
                        good. It is no use our being impatient with the Lord over that reality,
                        for it is clearly a
                        condition to which we agreed so long ago. Even when the veil is parted
                        briefly, it will be on His terms--not ours.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>Without the
                        veil, we would lose that precious insulation, thus interfering with our
                        mortal probation and maturation. Without the veil, our brief mortal
                        walk in a
                        darkening world would lose its meaning--for one would scarcely carry
                        the flashlight of faith at noonday and in the presence of the Light of
                        the World!</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>Without the
                        veil, we could not experience the gospel of work and the sweat of our
                        brow. If we had the security of having already entered into God's rest,
                        certain
                        things would be unneeded; Adam and Eve did not clutch Social Security
                        cards in the Garden of Eden!</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>And how
                        could we learn about obedience if we were shielded from the
                        consequences of our disobedience? And how could we learn patience under
                        pressure if
                        we did not experience pressure and waiting?</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>Nor could
                        we choose for ourselves if we were already in His holy presence, for
                        some alternatives do not there exist. Besides, God's court is filled
                        with those
                        who have patiently overcome--whose company we do not yet deserve.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>Fortunately,
                        the veil keeps the first, second, and third estates separate, hence our
                        sense of separateness. The veil avoids having things "compound in one"
                        (2 Ne.
                        2:11)--to our everlasting detriment. We are cocooned, as it were, in
                        order that we might truly choose. Once, long ago, we chose to come to
                        this very setting
                        where we could choose. It was an irrevocable choice! And the veil is
                        the guarantor that our ancient choice is honored.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>When the
                        veil which now encloses us is no more, time will also be no more (see
                        D&amp;C 84:100). Even now, time is clearly not our natural dimension.
                        Thus it is
                        that we are never really at home in time. Alternately, we find
                        ourselves impatiently wishing to hasten the passage of time or to hold
                        back the dawn. We can do
                        neither, of course. Whereas the bird is at home in the air, we are
                        clearly not at home in time--because we belong to eternity! Time, as
                        much as any one thing,
                        whispers to us that we are strangers here. If time were natural to us,
                        why is it that we have so many clocks and wear wristwatches?</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>Thus the
                        veil stands--not to forever shut us out--but as a reminder of God's
                        tutoring and patient love for us. Any brush against it produces a
                        feeling of "not
                        yet," but also faint whispers of anticipation of that moment when, in
                        the words of today's choral hymn, "Come, Let Us Anew," those who have
                        prevailed "by
                        the patience of hope and the labor of love" will hear the glorious
                        words, "Well and faithfully done; enter into my joy and sit down on my
                        throne" (Hymns, no.
                        17). [From "Patience," <em>Ensign</em>, Oct. 1980, p. 31]</big></big><br

                        born into this
                        world, we only have a vague recollection of our preexistent life. By
                        the inspiration of the Spirit "we see through a glass darkly" and
                        we "know in part." Ultimately our previous knowledge will be restored
                        to us, when that which is perfect comes, and then we shall know even as
                        also we are
                        known. Here we have the reason why the world did not recognize Jesus
                        when he came in the flesh: "He was in the world, and the world was made
                        by him, and
                        the world knew him not." (John 1:10.)</big></big></p>

                        the veil of
                        darkness, or forgetfulness, which deprives us of the recollection of
                        our existence in the spirit world before this earth was made and of the
                        acquaintances we had here, will be lifted. Then we will see as we are
                        seen and know as we are known and as we were known before earth life.
