                        requires both turning away
                        from evil and turning to God. (See Deut. 4:30; see also Bible
                        Dictionary, s.v. "Repentance.") When "a
                        mighty change" is required, full repentance involves a 180-degree turn,
                        and without looking back! (Alma 5:12-13.) Initially, this turning
                        reflects
                        progress from telestial to terrestrial behavior, and later on to
                        celestial behavior. As the sins of the telestial world are left behind,
                        the focus falls
                        ever more steadily upon the sins of omission, which often keep us from
                        full consecration. ("Repentance," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1991, p. 30)</font></big></big><br

                        remains a comparative stranger to Jesus'
                        holy temples and His holy scriptures, two vital dimensions of
                        discipleship. But she could have Christ's image in her countenance (see

                        5:14).</font></big></big></p>

                        individual family members. Though a
                        comparative stranger to Jesus' gentleness and kindness, which we are
                        instructed to emulate, a little more effort by this father would make
                        such
                        a large difference.</font></big></big></p>

                        returned missionary,
                        skills polished while serving an honorable mission, striving earnestly
                        for success in his career. Busy, he ends
                        up in a posture of some accommodation with the world. Thus he forgoes
                        building up the kingdom first and instead builds up himself. A small
                        course correction now would make a large, even destinational,
                        difference for him later on.</font></big></big></p>

                        deficiencies just illustrated are
                        those of omission. Once the telestial sins are left behind and
                        henceforth avoided, the focus falls ever more
                        on the sins of omission. These omissions signify a lack of qualifying
                        fully for the celestial kingdom. Only greater consecration can correct
                        these
                        omissions, which have consequences just as real as do the sins of
                        commission. Many of us thus have sufficient faith to avoid the major
                        sins of
                        commission, but not enough faith to sacrifice our distracting
                        obsessions or to focus on our omissions.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Most
                        omissions occur because we fail to
                        get outside ourselves. We are so busy checking on our own temperatures,
                        we do not notice the
                        burning fevers of others even when we can offer them some of the needed
                        remedies, such as encouragement, kindness, and commendation. The hands
                        which hang down and most need to be lifted up belong to those too
                        discouraged even to reach out anymore. ("Swallowed Up in the

                            valiant, the faithful, the perfected, for they will go into the
                            celestial kingdom prepared for those who live the celestial laws. But
                            into the
                            terrestrial will go those who do not measure up to the celestial.
                            Speaking of one category of terrestrial people, the Lord says: "These
                            are they
                            who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain
                            not the crown over the kingdom of our God." (D&amp;C 76:79.) The
                            "unvaliant" Latter-day Saint will find himself there. (<em>The

                            the seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the great
                            vision given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, I remember that the
                            Lord says to that terrestrial degree of glory may go those who are not
                            valiant in the testimony, which means that many of us who have
                            received baptism by proper authority, many who have received other
                            ordinances, even temple blessings, will not reach the celestial kingdom
                            of glory unless we live the commandments and are valiant. There are
                            many people in this Church today who think they live, but they are
                            dead to the spiritual things. And I believe even many who are making
                            pretenses of being active are also spiritually dead. Their service is
                            much of the letter and less of the spirit. (<em>The Teachings of

                            "many are called, but few are chosen." (D&amp;C 121:40.) As the
                            Savior put it, "... strait is the gate, and narrow the way, which
                            leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." And conversely, "
                            ... wide is the
                            gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
                            be which go in thereat." (Matt. 7:13, 14.) It is true that many
                            Latter-day Saints, having been baptized and confirmed members of the
                            Church, and some even having received their endowments and
                            having been married and sealed in the holy temple, have felt that they
                            were thus guaranteed the blessings of exaltation and eternal life. But
                            this is not so. There are two basic requirements every soul must
                            fulfill or he cannot attain to the great blessings offered. He must
                            receive the
                            ordinances and he must be faithful, overcoming his weaknesses. Hence,

                            denying
                            ourselves the lusts and appetites of the flesh. "For it is better," the
                            resurrected Jesus said, "that ye should deny yourselves of these
                            things,
                            wherein ye will take up your cross" (3 Ne. 12:30). Thus, the daily
                            taking up of the cross means daily denying ourselves the appetites of
                            the
                            flesh. ("Overcome &#8230; Even As I Also Overcame," <em>Ensign</em>, May

                            Even in the midst of our obvious imperfections, a sacred process is to

                            the temple reminds us that although as mortals we are in the world, we

                        an explanation of the

                        reference to marriage for time and all
                        eternity only, but to every ordinance and blessing of the gospel.
                        Baptism into the Church is sealed by this Spirit, likewise
                        confirmation,
                        ordination, and all ordinances as well as marriage for time and all

                        that man receives through the

                        with [page 95] a promise. The promise is that the blessing will be
                        obtained, if
                        those who seek it are true and faithful to the end. If they are not
                        faithful, then the Holy Spirit will withdraw the blessing, and the
                        promise comes
                        to an end. (<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, 2:94)</font></big></big></p>

                        the 76th
                        section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Speaking of those who are
                        candidates for celestial glory, the Lord says:</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">"They are
                        they who received the
                        testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized after
                        the manner of his burial That by keeping
                        the commandments they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins
                        and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands . . . And who
                        overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise, which
                        the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true" (D&amp;C

                        sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise. We have that
                        same phrase repeated in section 132, verse 19, for the Lord is speaking
                        now of celestial marriage.</font></big></big></p>

                        exactly the same principle is implied.
                        By the laying on of hands we get the promise of power and authority,
                        but it will not be ours -- worlds without end -- unless we keep our

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">And in the
                        128th section of the

                        Elder Melvin J. Ballard, in his Three

                        they are also sealed by the holy spirit of
                        promise, the Holy Ghost, one who reads the thoughts and hearts of men

                        contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths,
                        vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations") must

                        Spirit of Promise is another
                        way of saying the Holy Ghost. What the scriptures mean when they say
                        that something must be sealed by
                        the Holy Spirit of Promise is that it must receive the approval of the
                        Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can see into the heart of each of us and can
                        consequently discern deceit, half-truths, or misrepresentations. Thus,
                        when a sealing ordinance is "sealed by the Holy Spirit," the Holy Ghost
                        is
                        satisfied that the parties to the sealing ordinance have been obedient
                        in order to enter into the sealing ordinance and afterward obedient to
                        the
                        covenants they have made. ("Marriage in the Lord's Way, Part One," <em>Ensign</em>,

                            the Holy Spirit of Promise is one which is ratified by the Holy
                            Ghost; it is one which is approved by the Lord; and the person who has

                            who are just and true." (D. &amp; C. 76:53.) If they are not just and

                        operation and power of the Holy
                        Spirit of Promise is best illustrated by the ordinance and contract of
                        baptism. An unworthy candidate for
                        baptism might deceive the elders and get the ordinance performed, but
                        no one can lie to the Holy Ghost and get by undetected. Accordingly,
                        the
                        baptism of an unworthy and unrepentant person would not be sealed by
                        the Spirit; it would not be ratified by the Holy Ghost; the unworthy
                        person would not be justified by the Spirit in his actions. If
                        thereafter he became worthy through repentance and obedience, the seal
                        would then
                        be put in force. Similarly, if a worthy person is baptized with the
                        ratifying approval of the Holy Ghost attending the performance, yet the
                        seal may
                        be broken by subsequent sin. </font></big></big></p>

                        principles also apply to every
                        other ordinance and performance in the Church. Thus if both parties are
                        "just and true," if they are worthy, a
                        ratifying seal is placed on their temple marriage; if they are
                        unworthy, they are not justified by the Spirit and the ratification of
                        the Holy Ghost is
                        withheld. Subsequent worthiness will put the seal in force, and
                        unrighteousness will break any seal. (<em>Mormon Doctrine</em>, p.362)</font></big></big></p>

                            to multiply on the face of the earth, and the heads of families
                            became their kings and priests, that is, the fathers of their own
                            people. And they were more or less under the influence and guidance of
                            the
                            Almighty. We read, for instance, in our revelations pertaining to these
                            matters, of a man called Melchizedek, who was a great high priest. We
                            are told that there were a great many high priests in his day, and
                            before him and after him; and these men had communication with God, and
                            were taught of him in relation to their general proceedings, and
                            acknowledged the hand of God in all things with which they were
                            associated. (<em>The Gospel Kingdom</em>, p.139)</font></big></big></li>

                        with many obstacles, but it is a real possibility. ("The Abundant

                            heir of all things in heaven, and upon earth. What more can
                            a person want, if he is made a joint heir of all things; and one
                            revelation says, he that is a faithful and wise steward in time shall
                            inherit all
                            things; consequently they are equal in dominion, and in power, and in
                            might, as the vision states. This don't say that each one shall
                            actually
                            control, and govern, and manage all things; that is a very different

                            considered as the inheritor of all the properties of the Church; yet
                            when he comes to the management of property, he has only a share, so in
                            heavenly things, a person may have the management of only one world, or
                            of two, or of three; or of as many as there are particles of dust that
                            compose our globe, yet, after all, each can proclaim himself as the
                            inheritor of all things, being a joint heir of the grand universal
                            inheritance. (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 2:102)</font></big></big></li>

                            one, "Does not that oneness mean one person?" No; Jesus meant that
                            those who believed in him through his servants, might be
                            able to come up to that fullness and glory and power and exaltation
                            which he inherited, even to the fulness of the celestial glory, to be
                            crowned with God the Eternal Father, and with his Only Begotten, to be
                            made equal, as it were, with them, in power and dominion; agreeing
                            with some modern revelations God has given through the Prophet Joseph
                            Smith. He said all they that receive this Priesthood, that is, those
                            who receive the testimony of the servants of God, they receive me; and
                            whosoever receives my Father, receives my Father's kingdom;
                            whereupon all that my Father hath shall be given to him. This is a
                            glorious promise, to be joint heirs with the Son of God in the
                            inheritance of
                            all things, even the fullness and glory of the Celestial world, their
                            bodies eventually to become glorified, spiritual bodies of flesh and
                            bones,
                            the same as God the Father. (<em>Journal of Discourses</em> 18:293)</font></big></big></li>

                        principle connected with
                        this that I think is very important to us as a people and as a Church
                        on the earth. With all the divisions, and
                        all the discontent, and the quarrelings and opposition among the powers
                        on earth, or that have been revealed from heaven, I have never heard
                        that it has ever been revealed to the children of men that there was
                        any division between God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
                        Ghost. They are one. They always have been one. They always will be
                        one, from eternity unto eternity. Our Heavenly Father stands at the
                        head,
                        being the author of the salvation of the children of men, having
                        created and peopled the world and given laws to the inhabitants of the
                        earth.
                        This principle is shown unto us by the revelation of the laws which
                        belong to the different kingdoms. There is a celestial kingdom, a
                        terrestrial
                        kingdom, and a telestial kingdom. There is a glory of the sun; a glory
                        of the moon, and a glory of the stars; and as one star differs from
                        another
                        star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead. <em>In the
                            celestial kingdom of God there is oneness. -- there is union</em>. (<em>The
