                    many fascinating, exciting things to do, or so many
                    challenges pressing upon you, that it is hard to keep focused on that
                    which is essential?&nbsp; When things of the world crowd in, all to
                    often the wrong things are allowed to take highest priority.&nbsp; Then
                    it is easy to forget the fundamental purpose of life.&nbsp; Satan has a
                    powerful tool to use against good people, those who are committed to a
                    worthy, righteous life, who want to do good and intend to make the most
                    of this life.&nbsp; His tool is <span style="font-style: italic;">distraction</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    He has an extensive array of undeniably good things that are used to
                    keep us from doing the essential ones.&nbsp; Have you noticed that when
                    you begin to focus on something truly important, something of eternal
                    significance, there often come thoughts of other good things to
                    distract you?&nbsp; Satan promotes distraction.&nbsp; He would have
                    good people fill life with "good things" so there is no room for the
                    "essential ones."&nbsp; Have you unconsciously&nbsp; been caught in
                    that trap?&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    Remember that you are here on earth for a divine purpose.&nbsp; The
                    purpose is not to be endlessly entertained or to be constantly in full
                    pursuit of pleasure.&nbsp; You are here to be tried, to prove yourself
                    so that&nbsp; you can receive the additional blessings God has for you.

                        <span style="font-family: arial;">We should begin by
                            recognizing the reality that just because something is </span><em
                            style="font-family: arial;">good</em><span style="font-family: arial;">
                            is not a sufficient reason for doing it. The number of good things we
                            can do far exceeds the time available to accomplish them. Some things
                            are better than good, and these are the things that should command
                            priority attention in our lives.&nbsp; ... As we consider various
                            choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is
                            good. Other choices are better, and still others are best. Even though
                            a particular choice is more costly, its far greater value may make it
                            the best choice of all.&nbsp; Consider how we use our time in the
                            choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the
                            Internet, or reading books or magazines. Of course it is good to view
                            wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not
                            everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to
                            obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best. <small>("Good,
