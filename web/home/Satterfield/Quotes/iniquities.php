                        we call mortality, does not, within the short space of time we are
                        allowed here, give to all of us perfect justice, perfect health, or
                        perfect opportunities. Perfect justice, however, will come eventually
                        through a divine plan, as will the perfection of all other conditions
                        and blessings--to those
                        who have lived to merit them. ("The Abundant Life," <em>Ensign</em>,

                            apparent injustices, when man must judge man and when uncontrollable
                            situations seem to bring undeserved disaster, but in the
                            judgment of God there will be no injustice and no soul will receive any
                            blessing, reward, or glory which he has not earned, and no soul will be
                            punished through
                            deprivation or otherwise for anything of which he was not guilty. (</span><em

                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big>All of us benefit from the
                        transcendent blessings of the Atonement and the Resurrection, through
                        which the divine healing process can work in our lives. The
                        hurt can be replaced by the joy the Savior promised. To the doubting
                        Thomas, Jesus said, "Be not faithless, but believing." Through faith
                        and righteousness all
                        of the inequities, injuries, and pains of this life can be fully
                        compensated for and made right. Blessings denied in this life will be
                        fully recompensed in the
                        eternities. Through complete repentance of our sins we can be forgiven
                        and we can enjoy eternal life. Thus our suffering in this life can be
                        as the refining fire,
                        purifying us for a higher purpose. Heartaches can be healed, and we can
                        come to know a soul-satisfying joy and happiness beyond our dreams and
                        expectations.

                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big>As Peter gained hope after a
                        moment of weakness, you, I, and everyone can enjoy the hope that comes
                        from the knowledge that God truly lives. Such hope
                        springs from the belief that if we have faith, somehow He will help us
                        through our challenges--if not in this life, then surely in the life to
                        come. As Paul said to
                        the Corinthians, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are
                        of all men most miserable" [1 Corinthians 15:19]. In the eternal scheme
                        of things, wrongs
                        will be righted. In the perfect justice of the Lord, all who live
                        worthily will be compensated for blessings not enjoyed here. ("Hope, an
                        Anchor of the Soul,"
                        <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1999, p. 61)</big></big></p>

                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big>Some who are listening to this
                        message are probably saying, "But what about me?" We know that many
                        worthy and wonderful Latter-day Saints currently lack
                        the ideal opportunities and essential requirements for their progress.
                        Singleness, childlessness, death, and divorce frustrate ideals and
                        postpone the fulfillment of
                        promised blessings. In addition, some women who desire to be full-time
                        mothers and homemakers have been literally compelled to enter the
                        full-time work
                        force. But these frustrations are only temporary. The Lord has promised
                        that in the eternities no blessing will be denied his sons and
                        daughters who keep the
                        commandments, are true to their covenants, and desire what is right.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big>Many of the most important
                        deprivations of mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is
                        the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan
                        of happiness for all of our Father's worthy children. We know that will
                        be true of temple ordinances. I believe it will also be true of family
                        relationships and
                        experiences. ("The Great Plan of Happiness," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov.
                        1993, p. 75)</big></big></p>

                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big>Another idea that is powerful
                        to lift us from discouragement is that the work of The Church of Jesus
                        Christ of Latter-day Saints, "to bring to pass the &#8230; eternal
                        life of man" (Moses 1:39), is an eternal work. Not all problems are
                        overcome and not all needed relationships are fixed in mortality. The
                        work of salvation goes
                        on beyond the veil of death, and we should not be too apprehensive
                        about incompleteness within the limits of mortality. ("Powerful Ideas,"
                        <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1995,
                        p. 26)</big></big></p>

                            which are the consequences of circumstance or others' acts and not our
                            own decisions. ("Jesus Christ, Our Redeemer," </span><em
