                        our
                        generation, have the forces of evil been so blatant, so brazen, so
                        aggressive
                        as they are today. Things we dared not speak about in earlier times are
                        now constantly projected into our living rooms. All sensitivity is cast
                        aside as reporters and pundits speak with a disgusting plainness of
                        things
                        that can only stir curiosity and lead to evil. . . . The home is under
                        siege. So many families are being destroyed. . . . Sisters, guard your
                        children. They live in a world of evil. The forces are all about them.

                        [1] Amongst His earliest commands to Adam and Eve, the Lord said:
                        "Multiply and replenish the earth." He has repeated that command in our
                        day. He has again revealed in this, the last dispensation, the
                        principle
                        of the eternity of the marriage covenant. He has restored to earth the
                        authority for entering into that covenant, and has declared that it is
                        the only due and proper way of joining husband and wife, and the only
                        means
                        by which the sacred family relationship may be carried beyond the grave
                        and through eternity. He has declared that this eternal relationship
                        may
                        be created only by the ordinances which are administered in the holy
                        temples
                        of the Lord, and therefore that His people should marry only in His
                        temple
                        in accordance with such ordinances.</big></p>

                        and wife to obey the command given to Adam to multiply and replenish
                        the
                        earth, so that the legions of choice spirits waiting for their
                        tabernacles
                        of flesh may come here and move forward under God's great design to
                        become
                        perfect souls, for without these fleshly tabernacles they cannot
                        progress
                        to their God-planned destiny. Thus, every husband and wife should
                        become
                        a father and mother in Israel to children born under the holy, eternal

                        Himself
                        by having taken advantage of the opportunity He offered, an obligation
                        of the most sacred kind, because the fate of that spirit in the
                        eternities
                        to come, the blessings or punishments which shall await it in the
                        hereafter,
                        depend, in great part, upon the care, the teachings, the training which
                        the parents shall give to that spirit.
                    </big></p>
                    <p><big>[4] No parent can escape that obligation and that
                        responsibility, and
                        for the proper meeting thereof, the Lord will hold us to a strict
                        accountability.&nbsp;
                        No loftier duty than this can be assumed by mortals.

                    <p><big>[5] Motherhood thus becomes a holy calling, a sacred
                        dedication for
                        carrying out the Lord's plans, a consecration of devotion to the
                        uprearing
                        and fostering, the nurturing in body, mind, and spirit, of those who
                        kept
                        their first estate and who come to this earth for their second estate
                        "to
                        see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall
                        command
                        them." (Abraham 3:25) To lead them to keep their second estate is the
                        work
                        of motherhood and "they who keep their second estate shall have glory
                        added

                        cannot do it; hired help cannot do it--only mother, aided as much as
                        may
                        be by the loving hands of father, brothers, and sisters, can give the
                        full
                        needed measure of watchful care. The mother who entrusts her child to
                        the
                        care of others, that she may do non-motherly work, whether for gold,
                        for
                        fame, or for civic service, should remember that "a child left to
                        himself
                        bringeth his mother to shame." (Prop. 29: 15) In our day the Lord has
                        said
                        that unless parents teach their children the doctrines of the Church
                        "the
                        sin be upon the heads of the parents." (D. &amp; C 68:25)

                    <p><big>[7]&nbsp; Motherhood is near to divinity.&nbsp; It is the
                        highest, holiest
                        service to be assumed by mankind. It places her who honors its holy
                        calling
                        and service next to the angels. To you mothers in Israel we say God
                        bless
                        and protect you, and give you the strength and courage, the faith and
                        knowledge,
                        the holy love and consecration to duty, that shall enable you to fill
                        to
                        the fullest measure the sacred calling which is yours. To you mothers
                        and
                        mothers-to-be we say: Be chaste, keep pure, live righteously, that your
                        posterity to the last generation may call you blessed. (Conference
