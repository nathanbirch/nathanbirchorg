                                    How little they understand! The Lord said through Joseph Smith:
                                    "Whatever God requires is right, no matter what it is, although we may
                                    not see the reason thereof until long after the events transpire."
                                    (Scrapbook of Mormon Literature, vol. 2, p. 173.)&nbsp; When men obey
                                    commands of a creator, <span style="font-style: italic;">it is not
                                        blind obedience</span>. How different is the cowering of a subject to
                                    his totalitarian monarch and the dignified, willing obedience one gives
                                    to his God. The dictator is ambitious, selfish, and has ulterior
                                    motives. God's every command is righteous, every directive purposeful,
                                    and all for the good of the governed. The first may be blind obedience,
                                    but the latter is certainly faith obedience. <span
                                        style="font-style: italic;">The patriarch Abraham, sorely tried,
                                        obeyed faithfully when commanded by the Lord to offer his son Isaac
                                        upon the altar. Blind obedience? No. He knew that God would require
                                        nothing of him which was not for his ultimate good.</span> How that
                                    good could be accomplished he did not understand. [<i>The Teachings of

                                        will have all kinds of trials to pass through. And it is quite as
                                        necessary for you to be tried as it was for Abraham and other men of
                                        God, and (said he) God will feel after you, and He will take hold of
                                        you and wrench your very heart strings, and if you cannot stand it you
                                        will not be fit for an inheritance in the Celestial Kingdom of God</span>."
                                    Some people have wondered why so many of the Twelve fell away. God
                                    tries people according to the position they occupy. [<i>Journal of

                                    tried. I heard Joseph Smith say--and I presume Brother Snow heard him
                                    also--in preaching to the Twelve in Nauvoo, that the Lord would get
                                    hold of their heart strings and wrench them, and that they would have
                                    to be tried as Abraham was tried. Well, some of the Twelve could not
                                    stand it. They faltered and fell by the way. It was not everybody that
                                    could stand what Abraham stood. <span style="font-style: italic;">And
                                        Joseph said that if God had known any other way whereby he could have
                                        touched Abraham's feelings more acutely and more keenly he would have
                                        done so.</span> [<i>Journal of Discourses</i>, 24:264; emphasis added]</big></big>

                                    us here to test us and to prove us. We were true in keeping our first
                                    estate. The people that are here today stood loyally by God and by
                                    Jesus, and they did not flinch. If you had flinched then, you would not
                                    be here with the Priesthood upon you. The evidence that you were loyal,
                                    that you were true and that you did not waver is to be found in the
                                    fact that you have received the Gospel and the everlasting
                                    Priesthood.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Now you are in
                                        your second estate, and you are going to be tested again. Will you be
                                        true and loyal to God with the curtain drawn between you and Him, shut
                                        out from His presence, and in the midst of darkness and temptation,
                                        with Satan and his invisible hosts all around you, bringing all manner
                                        of evil influences to bear upon you? The men and the women that will be
                                        loyal under these circumstances God will exalt, because it will be the
                                        highest test to which they can be subjected.</span> (<i>Gospel Truth</i>,
