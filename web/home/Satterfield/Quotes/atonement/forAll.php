                                    the atonement (it is so written, and I firmly believe it), that Christ
                                    has died for all. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He has
                                        paid the full debt, whether you receive the gift or not.</span> But if
                                    we continue to sin, to lie, steal, bear false witness, we must repent
                                    of and forsake that sin to have the full efficacy of the blood of
                                    Christ. Without this it will be of no effect; repentance must come, in
                                    order that the atonement may prove a benefit to us. Let all who are
                                    doing wrong cease doing wrong; live no longer in transgression, no
                                    matter of what kind; but live every day of your lives according to the
                                    revelations given, and so that your examples may be worthy of
                                    imitation. Let us remember that we never get beyond the purview of our

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>There was
                        never
                        a sin committed in this world for which reparation has not been, or
                        will not have to be made. If I sin, there must be a reparation or
                        penalty
                        required to pay the debt. If you sin, it is the same. There never was
                        any sin committed, big or small, that has not been atoned for, or that
                        will not have to be
                        atoned for.... Justice made certain demands, and Adam could not pay the
                        price, so mercy steps in. The Son of God says: "I will go down and pay
                        the price. I will
                        be the Redeemer and redeem men from Adam's transgression. I will take
                        upon me the sins of the world and redeem or save every soul from his
                        own sins who
                        will repent." That is the only condition. The Savior does not save
                        anybody from his individual sins only on condition of his repentance.
                        So the effect of Adam's
                        transgression was to place all of us in the pit with him. Then the
                        Savior comes along, not subject to that pit, and towers the ladder. He
                        comes down into the pit
                        and makes it possible for us to use the ladder to escape. (<em>Doctrines

                        transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4.), and for such transgression a
                        punishment is affixed under eternal law. Every normal individual is
                        responsible
                        for the sins he commits, and would be similarly liable to the
                        punishment attached to those broken laws. However, Christ's death on
                        the cross offers us
                        exemption from the eternal punishment for most sins. He took upon
