                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The Atonement is
                    the chief expression of Christ's loving-kindness. He endured so many
                    things. For instance, as prophesied, He was spat upon (see 1 Ne. 19:9).
                    As foretold, He was struck and scourged (see Mosiah 3:9). Likewise, He
                    was offered vinegar and gall while aflame with thirst (see Ps. 69:21).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Yet in His later
                    description of His agonies, Jesus does not speak of those things.
                    Instead, after the Atonement, there is no mention about His being spat
                    upon,
                    struck, or proffered vinegar and gall. Instead, Christ confides in us
                    His chief anxiety, namely, that He "would that [He] might not drink the
                    bitter cup, and
                    shrink" (D&amp;C 19:18)--especially desiring not to get partway through
                    the Atonement and then pull back. Mercifully for all of us, He
                    "finished [His] preparations
                    unto the children of men" (D&amp;C 19:19). Jesus partook of history's
                    bitterest cup without becoming bitter! Significantly, when He comes
                    again in majesty and
                    power, He will cite His aloneness, saying, "I have trodden the
                    wine-press alone" (D&amp;C 133:50).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The Book of
                    Mormon describes Jesus' Atonement as the "infinite atonement" (Alma
                    34:12); it certainly required infinite suffering. When suffering and
                    burdened Jesus entered Gethsemane, He "fell on the ground" (Mark
                    14:35). He did not merely kneel down, pray intensely and briefly, and
                    leave. His agonies
                    were so great that He began to bleed at every one of thousands of His
                    pores (see D&amp;C 19:18). An angel, whose identity we do not know,
                    came to strengthen
                    Him (see Luke 22:43). Mark wrote that Jesus became "sore amazed" and
                    "very heavy" (Mark 14:33), meaning in the Greek, respectively,
                    "astonished and
                    awestruck" and "depressed and dejected." None of us can tell Christ
                    anything about depression!</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>In the course of
                    that great prayer, He pled with the Father in the most intimate and
                    familial of terms, "Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;
                    take away
                    this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt"
                    (Mark 14:36). This was not theater but real pleading to a loving Father
                    from a suffering Son
                    in the deepest possible distress!</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>In the Atonement
                    Jesus experienced what He later described as "the fierceness of the
                    wrath of Almighty God" (D&amp;C 76:107; D&amp;C 88:106). We can't even
                    begin to imagine what it would have been like as He stood in our places
                    and paid the price for our sins.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Though sinless
                    Himself, He bore the sins of billions. Thus His empathy and mercy
                    became fully perfected and personalized. Indeed, He thus "descended
                    below
                    all things, in that he comprehended all things" (D&amp;C 88:6; see also
                    122:8).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>He was scourged,
                    most likely with a Roman flagellum of several thongs; at the end of
                    each were sharp objects designed to tear the flesh. His tensed back
                    muscles would have been torn. If he was struck with the usual number of
                    blows, 39, the first blows would have bruised and the last blows would
                    have shredded
                    His flesh. Believing Christian physicians wrote that, medically
                    speaking, Jesus would have been in serious, if not critical, medical
                    condition because of the loss
                    of blood; and, as we know by revelation, He had previously bled from
                    every pore in the Garden of Gethsemane (see William D. Edwards, Wesley
                    J. Gabel,
                    Floyd E. Hosmer, "On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ," <em>Journal
                        of the American Medical Association</em>, 21 Mar. 1986, vol. 255, no.
                    11, 1458).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The divine
                    reproach Jesus felt so exquisitely, because of His meekly standing in
                    for us, fulfilled yet another prophecy: "Reproach hath broken my heart;
                    and I
                    am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was
                    none; and for comforters, but I found none" (Ps. 69:20). His heart was
                    broken, as He did
                    "suffer both body and spirit" (D&amp;C 19:18). He trembled because of
                    pain, and yet He, amidst profound aloneness, finished His preparations,
                    bringing to pass the
                    unconditional immortality of all mankind and "eternal life" for all
                    those who would keep His commandments (Moses 1:39).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>At the apogee of
                    His agony, Jesus uttered on the cross the great soul cry of
                    foresakenness: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" (Matt.
                    27:46).
                    President Young's insight helps us understand His aloneness, which was
                    a unique dimension of His agony:</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>"At the very
                    moment, at the hour when the crisis came for him to offer up his life,
                    the Father withdrew Himself, withdrew His Spirit, and cast a vail over
                    [Jesus]. That is what made him sweat blood. If he had had the power of
                    God upon him, he would not have sweat blood; but all was withdrawn from
                    him, and a
                    veil was cast over him, and he then plead with the Father not to
                    forsake him" (in <em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 3:206).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>When Jesus comes
                    in overwhelming majesty and power, in at least one of His appearances
                    He will come in red attire, reminding us that He shed His blood to
                    atone for our sins (see D&amp;C 133:48; Isa. 63:1). His voice will be
                    heard to declare, again, how alone He once was: "I have trodden the
                    wine-press alone &#8230; and
                    none were with me" (D&amp;C 133:50).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The more we know
                    of Jesus' Atonement, the more we will humbly and gladly glorify Him,
                    His Atonement, and His character. We will never tire of paying
                    tribute to His goodness and loving-kindness. How long will we so speak
                    of our gratitude for His Atonement? The scriptures advise "forever and
                    ever"! (See
                    D&amp;C 133:52.) ["Enduring Well," <em>Ensign</em>, Apr. 1997, p. 10]<br>

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>At the ninth
                    hour, or about three in the afternoon, a loud voice, surpassing the
                    most anguished cry of physical suffering issued from the central cross,
                    rending
                    the dreadful darkness. It was the voice of the Christ: "Eloi, Eloi,
                    lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast
                    thou forsaken me?"
                    What mind of man can fathom the significance of that awful cry? It
                    seems, that in addition to the fearful suffering incident to
                    crucifixion, the agony of
                    Gethsemane had recurred, intensified beyond human power to endure. In
                    that bitterest hour the dying Christ was alone, alone in most terrible
                    reality. That the
                    supreme sacrifice of the Son might be consummated in all its fulness,
                    the Father seems to have withdrawn the support of His immediate
                    Presence, leaving to the
                    Savior of men the glory of complete victory over the forces of sin and
                    death. (<em>Jesus the Christ</em>, pp.660-661)</big><br

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>With great
                    mallets they drove spikes of iron through his feet and hands and

                    Willingly and lovingly, He took upon Himself not only our sins but the
                    pains, sicknesses, and sufferings of all mankind. He suffered similarly
                    on the cross, where He gave His life to pay the penalty for our sins if
                    we will repent.
                    And then in His ultimate triumph, He was resurrected and broke the
                    bands of death, making the Resurrection available to all. ("Growing

                <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><big style="font-family: arial;">I ask,
                        is there
                        a reason for men and women being exposed more constantly and more
                        powerfully, to the power of the enemy, by having visions than by not
                        having them?" There is and it is simply this-God never bestows upon His
                        people, or upon an individual, superior blessings without a severe
                        trial to prove
                        them, to prove that individual, or that people, to see whether they
                        will keep their covenants with Him, and keep in remembrance what He has
                        shown them. Then the greater the vision, the greater the display of the
                        power of the enemy. And when such individuals are off their guard they
                        are left to themselves, as
                        Jesus was. For this express purpose the Father withdrew His spirit from
                        His son, at the time he was to be crucified. Jesus had been with his
                        Father, talked with
                        Him, dwelt in His bosom, and knew all about heaven, about making the
                        earth, about the transgression of man, and what would redeem the
                        people, and that he
                        was the character who was to redeem the sons of earth, and the earth
                        itself from all sin that had come upon it. The light, knowledge, power,
                        and glory with
                        which he was clothed were far above, or exceeded that of all others who
                        had been upon the earth after the fall, consequently at the very
                        moment, at the hour
                        when the crisis came for him to offer up his life, the Father withdrew
                        Himself, withdrew His Spirit, and cast a vail over him. That is what
                        made him sweat
                        blood. If he had had the power of God upon him, he would not have sweat
                        blood; but all was withdrawn from him, and a veil was cast over him,
                        and he then
                        plead with the Father not to forsake him. "No," says the Father, "you
                        must have your trials, as well as others." (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>,
                        3:205-206)<br>
