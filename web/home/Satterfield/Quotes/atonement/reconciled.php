                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>"The man
                    Gabriel" came to Daniel and taught him that "Messiah the Prince" should
                    come "to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
                    righteousness." (Dan. 9:24-25.) That is to say, the Messiah would come
                    to make possible a reconciliation between God and man.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>In his lost and
                    fallen condition, man is in a state of sin and spiritual darkness and
                    is himself subject to and guilty of sin. "All have sinned, and come
                    short of the
                    glory of God." (Rom. 3:23.) "There is not a just man upon the earth,
                    that doeth good, and sinneth not." (Eccl. 7:20.) Christ only was
                    sinless. All accountable
                    men having sinned are thereby unclean and unable to dwell with or be in
                    the presence of their God. ...</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>Thus, to restore
                    man to a state of harmony and unity with Deity, man must repent,
                    receive a remission of his sins, become clean, and be thereby ransomed
                    from
                    his lost and fallen state. To be saved, man must be reconciled to God
                    through the atonement of his Son. "Be reconciled unto him through the
                    atonement of
                    Christ, his Only Begotten Son," Jacob preached, "and ye may obtain a
                    resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in
                    Christ, and be
                    presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and
                    [having] obtained a good hope of glory in him." (Jacob 4:11.)</big></p>

                    more glorious concept than this, that lowly and fallen and mortal and
                    sinful man- that all of us--can forsake our evil and wicked ways and
                    find harmony and unity with our Eternal Father? (<em>The Promised

                <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>In the English
                        language, the components are <em>at-one-ment</em>, suggesting that a
                        person is at one with another. Other languages [such as Spanish,
                        Portuguese, French,
                        Italian, and German] employ words that connote either <em>expiation </em>or
                        <em>reconciliation</em>. Expiation means "to atone for." Reconciliation
                        comes from Latin roots re,
                        meaning "again"; con, meaning "with"; and sella, meaning "seat."
                        Reconciliation, therefore, literally means "to sit again with." ....
                        The Savior's gift of
                        immortality comes to all who have ever lived. But His gift of eternal
                        life requires repentance and obedience to specific ordinances and
                        covenants. Essential
                        ordinances of the gospel symbolize the Atonement. Baptism by immersion
                        is symbolic of the death, burial, and Resurrection of the Redeemer.
                        Partaking of the
                        sacrament renews baptismal covenants and also renews our memory of the
                        Savior's broken flesh and of the blood He shed for us. Ordinances of
                        the temple
                        symbolize our reconciliation with the Lord and seal families together
                        forever. ("The Atonement," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1996, p. 35)<br>
