                        the atonement accomplished by Jesus Christ--a redeeming service,
                        vicariously rendered in behalf of mankind, all of whom have become
                        estranged
                        from God by the effects of sin both inherited and individually
                        incurred--the way is opened for a reconciliation whereby man may come
                        again into communion
                        with God, and be made fit to dwell anew and forever in the presence of
                        his Eternal Father. This basal thought is admirably implied in our
                        English word,
                        "atonement," which, as its syllables attest, is at-one-ment, "denoting
                        reconciliation, or the bringing into agreement of those who have been
                        estranged." (<em>Jesus
                            the Christ</em>, p.23)<br style="font-family: arial;" wp="BR2">

                        is really three words: At-one-ment, meaning to set at one, one with
                        God; to reconcile, to conciliate, to expiate. ("Atonement, Agency,
                        Accountability," <em>Ensign</em>, May 1988, p. 69)<br

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>... let us now
                    ponder the deep meaning of the word <em>atonement</em>. In the English
                    language, the components are <em>at-one-ment</em>, suggesting that a
                    person is at one with
                    another. Other languages [such as Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian,
                    and German] employ words that connote either <em>expiation</em> or <em>reconciliation</em>.
                    Expiation
                    means "to atone for." Reconciliation comes from Latin roots re, meaning
                    "again"; <em>con</em>, meaning "with"; and <em>sella</em>, meaning
                    "seat." Reconciliation, therefore,
                    literally means "to sit again with."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>Rich meaning is
                    found in study of the word <em>atonement </em>in the Semitic
                    languages of Old Testament times. In Hebrew, the basic word for
                    atonement is <em>kaphar</em>, a
                    verb that means "to cover" or "to forgive." [We might even surmise that
                    if an individual qualifies for the blessings of the Atonement (through
                    obedience to the
                    principles and ordinances of the gospel), Jesus will "cover" our past
                    transgressions from the Father.] Closely related is the Aramaic and
                    Arabic word <em>kafat</em>,
                    meaning "a close embrace"-- no doubt related to the Egyptian ritual
                    embrace. References to that embrace are evident in the Book of Mormon.
                    One states that
                    "the Lord hath redeemed my soul &#8230; ; I have beheld his glory, and I am
                    encircled about eternally in the arms of his love" [2 Ne. 1:15].
                    Another proffers the
                    glorious hope of our being "clasped in the arms of Jesus" [Morm. 5:11;
                    additional examples are in Alma 5:33; Alma 34:16].</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>I weep for joy
                    when I contemplate the significance of it all. To be redeemed is to be
                    atoned - received in the close embrace of God with an expression not
                    only
                    of His forgiveness, but of our oneness of heart and mind. What a
                    privilege! And what a comfort to those of us with loved ones who have
                    already passed from
                    our family circle through the gateway we call death! ("The Atonement," <em>Ensign</em>,
                    Nov. 1996, p. 34)<br>
