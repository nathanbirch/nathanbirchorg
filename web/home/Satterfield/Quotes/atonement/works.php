                    sinned and need to repent to fully pay <em>our</em> part of the debt.
                    When we sincerely repent, the Savior's magnificent Atonement pays the <em>rest</em>
                    of that
                    debt [see 2 Ne. 25:23]. . . .</big></p>

                    can do to pay to the uttermost farthing and make right our wrongs, the
                    Savior's grace is activated in our lives through the Atonement, which
                    purifies us and can

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>As we sift the
                    ways of the world let us reject the commonly accepted attitude of
                    expecting the government to supply us with the necessities of life.
                    This
                    practice, if fully adopted, will change any society from one of freedom
                    to one of slavery. Let us contend for the gospel of work. Let us be
                    self-reliant. Salvation
                    is an individual matter. There will be no mass salvation. Some have
                    mistakenly concluded from Paul's statement--"For by grace are ye saved
                    through faith; and
                    that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works" (Eph.
                    2:8-9)--some have erroneously concluded from this statement that works
                    are not necessary.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The truth was
                    spoken by Nephi when he said, "We are saved [by grace], after all we
                    can do" (2 Ne. 25:23).</big></p>

                        will require maximum effort for us to bring ourselves within the reach
                        of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ so that we can be saved. There
                        will be no
                        government dole which can get us through the pearly gates. Nor will
                        anyone go through those gates who wants to go through on the efforts of
                        another.

                    accuse Latter-day Saints who give this answer of denying the grace of
                    God through claiming they can earn their own salvation. We answer this
                    accusation with the words of two Book of Mormon prophets. Nephi taught,
                    "For we labor diligently &#8230; to persuade our children &#8230; to believe in
                    Christ, and to
                    be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are
                    saved, after all we can do" (2 Ne. 25:23). And what is "all we can do"?
                    It surely includes
                    repentance (see Alma 24:11) and baptism, keeping the commandments, and
                    enduring to the end. Moroni pleaded, "Yea, come unto Christ, and be
                    perfected in
                    him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny
                    yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind
                    and strength, then is his
                    grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in
                    Christ" (Moro. 10:32). ["Have You Been Saved?" <em>Ensign</em>, May

                    think that is what the Lord meant by "grace" when he said, "My grace
                    shall attend you." I believe the definition of "grace" is implied in
                    the fourth
                    section of the Doctrine and Covenants where the Lord promised to those
                    who would engage vigorously in missionary work: ". . . and lo, he that
                    thrusteth in his
                    sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth
                    not, but bringeth salvation to his soul." (Ibid., 4:4.) The saving
                    "grace" of the Lord's atoning
                    power would extend to the giver as well as to those who would receive
                    the saving ordinances of the gospel. (Conference Report, April 1961,

                    accepts the scriptural doctrine that following the resurrection each

                    God's
                    justice and receive a final judgment based on his performance during
                    his mortal probation, that the verdict will turn on obedience or
                    disobedience to the laws
                    and ordinances of the gospel. If these laws and ordinances have been
                    complied with during mortal life, the candidate will be cleansed from
                    the stain of sin by
                    the atoning blood of Jesus Christ and be saved in the celestial kingdom

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>He came into
                    this world and took upon him our individual sins on condition of our
                    repentance. Christ does not redeem any man from his individual sins who
                    will not repent and who will not accept him. All those who refuse to
                    accept him as the Redeemer and refuse to turn from their sins will have
                    to pay the price of
                    their own sinning. [He then quotes D&amp;C 19:16-19. (<em>Doctrines of

                    could not have stood it -- that is, a man such as we are. I do not care
                    what his fortitude what his power, there was <em>no man ever born into
                        this
                        world that could have stood under the weight of the load that was upon
                        the Son of God, when he was carrying my sins and yours</em> and making
                    it possible that we
                    might escape from our sins. He carried that load for us if we will only
                    accept him as our Redeemer and keep his commandments. Some of us find
                    it so hard, so
                    terribly hard, to do the little things that are asked of us, and yet he
                    was willing to carry all that tremendous load and weight of sin-not his
                    own, for he had no sin.
                    He did it that we might escape. He paid the price, the penalty of our
                    sinning.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>So I say there
                    never was a sin committed that was not atoned for. Christ paid the debt
                    of my sins on one condition, and that is that I will believe in him and
                    keep
                    his commandments. He did that for you and for every other person in the
                    world; but he never paid any debt on the cross, or before he went on
                    the cross, for the
                    sins of any of us, if we will be rebellious. <em>If we are rebellious,
                        we will have to pay the price ourselves</em>. (<em>Doctrines of

                            says that Christ came "to make reconciliation for the sins of the
                            people." (Heb. 2:17.) "He is the propitiation for our sins." (1 Jn.
                            2:2.) If we repent, are
                            baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and keep the
                            commandments, we are in fact reconciled to Deity. The great
                            propitiation operates in our lives. We are
                            then, as Paul expressed it, "in Christ." We have become new creatures.
                            It is of such that the ancient apostle says: "God hath reconciled us to
                            himself by Jesus
                            Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation." That is,
                            being reconciled we have also certain obligations. We have received not
                            only the fact of
                            reconciliation, and how glorious that is, but also "the ministry of
                            reconciliation." (</span><em style="font-family: arial;">The Promised
