                    of Adam, the iniquities
                    of the antediluvians, of the depth of iniquity that would be connected

                    fall of man, and his redemption; He knew the plan of salvation and
                    pointed it out; He was

                    the living and the dead, and has made ample provision for their
                    redemption, according to their several circumstances, and the laws of

                        course, the
                        Father knew beforehand of all human wickedness. He knew beforehand of
                        mankind's need of a Savior. He knows the past, present, and future,
                        since all their dimensions are continually before Him, said the Prophet
                        Joseph Smith, constituting "one eternal 'now'" (<em>Teachings of the
                            Prophet Joseph Smith,
                        </em>sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co.,
                        1938], p. 220; see also 1 Ne. 10:19; D&amp;C 3:2; 35:1). Therefore,
                        mortal sins previously
                        committed and those yet to be committed were atoned for <em>retroactively</em>
                        and <em>prospectively</em> in Gethsemane and on Calvary. For us of the
                        last dispensation, it was
                        "paid in advance," as it were. However, the individual sinner is still
                        left with his own need to claim that divine payment by meeting the
                        conditions set by Christ,
                        thus working through those sins, as prescribed, by currently applying
                        the atoning blood of Jesus. (<em>One More Strain of Praise </em>[Salt
