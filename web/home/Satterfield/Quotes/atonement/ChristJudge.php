                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Multiple
                    revelations teach us that redeeming Jesus is uniquely our "advocate
                    with the Father," that He pleads for us, and that He makes intercession
                    for us (see
                    1 Jn. 2:1; 2 Ne. 2:9; Mosiah 5:8; D&amp;C 32:3; 45:3; 62:1; 110:4).
                    Without this grand reality we would be helpless, and all would be truly
                    and finally hopeless.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Jesus' personal
                    role is unique in yet another way: "For the Father judgeth no man, but
                    hath committed all judgment unto the Son" ( John 5:22). "Jesus, our
                    Redeemer," has earned this special standing, entitling Him not only to
                    plead for us but also to judge us, which His unique suffering made
                    possible by virtue of
                    His agonies during the Atonement (see Mosiah 15:8; D&amp;C 45:35).
                    Thus, by His suffering and by divine investiture, in one sense Jesus is
                    both advocate and
                    judge!</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Only an
                    omniscient, all-loving God could have both roles of advocate (pleading
                    for the petitioner) and judge (deciding the ultimate fate of the
                    petitioner). This
                    is because He possesses a perfect balance of the qualities of justice
                    and mercy and all other divine attributes that make Him perfect, or
                    complete, in all the
                    Godly virtues. (<em>One More Strain of Praise </em>[Salt Lake City:
