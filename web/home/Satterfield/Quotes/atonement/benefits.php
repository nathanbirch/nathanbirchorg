                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The Atonement
                    not only benefits the sinner but also benefits those sinned
                    against--that is, the victims. By forgiving "those who trespass against
                    us" (JST, Matt.
                    6:13) the Atonement brings a measure of peace and comfort to those who
                    have been innocently victimized by the sins of others. The basic source
                    for the healing
                    of the soul is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. This is true whether it
                    be from the pain of a personal tragedy or a terrible national calamity
                    such as we have
                    recently experienced in New York and Washington, D.C., and near
                    Pittsburgh.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>A sister who had
                    been through a painful divorce wrote of her experience in drawing from
                    the Atonement. She said: "Our divorce &#8230; did not release me from the
                    obligation to forgive. I truly wanted to do it, but it was as if I had
                    been commanded to do something of which I was simply incapable." Her
                    bishop gave her
                    some sound advice: "Keep a place in your heart for forgiveness, and
                    when it comes, welcome it in." Many months passed as this struggle to
                    forgive continued.
                    She recalled: "During those long, prayerful moments &#8230; I tapped into a
                    life-giving source of comfort from my loving Heavenly Father. I sense
                    that he was not
                    standing by glaring at me for not having accomplished forgiveness yet;
                    rather he was sorrowing with me as I wept. &#8230; </big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>"In the final
                    analysis, what happened in my heart is for me an amazing and miraculous
                    evidence of the Atonement of Christ. I had always viewed the
                    Atonement as a means of making repentance work for the sinner. I had
                    not realized that it also makes it possible for the one sinned against
                    to receive into his or
                    her heart the sweet peace of forgiving."[Name Withheld, "My Journey to
                    Forgiving," <em>Ensign,</em> Feb. 1997, 42-43].</big></p>

                            injured
                            should do what they can to work through their trials, and the Savior
                            will "succor his people according to their infirmities" [Alma 7:12]. He
                            will
                            help us carry our burdens. Some injuries are so hurtful and deep that
                            they cannot be healed without help from a higher power and hope for
                            perfect justice and
                            restitution in the next life. Since the Savior has suffered anything
                            and everything that we could ever feel or experience, [Alma 7:11] He
                            can help the weak to
                            become stronger. He has personally experienced all of it. He
                            understands our pain and will walk with us even in our darkest hours.
