                    king--how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him

                    redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world,

                    has been contracted by the children, and the Father demands recompense.
                    He says to his children on this earth, who are in sin and
                    transgression, it
                    is impossible for you to pay this debt; I will send my Only Begotten

                    this debt it can never
                    be paid. Can all the wisdom of the world devise means by which we can
                    be redeemed, and return to the presence of our Father and Elder
                    Brother, and dwell
                    with holy angels and celestial beings? No; it is beyond the power and

                    or ever will live, to
                    prepare or create a sacrifice that will pay this divine debt. But God
                    provided it, and his Son has paid it, and we, each and every one, can
                    now receive the truth
