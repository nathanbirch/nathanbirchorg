                    with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>It is the work
                    and mission and ministry of the Holy Spirit of God to sanctify the
                    souls of men. This is his assigned labor in the Eternal Godhead. How he
                    does it
                    we do not know, except that it is a work that can only be performed by
                    a spirit being, and hence the need for one of his personality, status,
                    and standing in the
                    Supreme Presidency of the universe.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Baptism of the
                    Spirit is the way and the means whereby sanctification is made
                    available. Thus, Jesus commands all the "ends of the earth" to be
                    baptized in
                    water "that ye may be sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost,
                    that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day" (3 Nephi 27:20.)
                    Truly, the Holy
                    Ghost is a sanctifier, and the extent to which men receive and enjoy
                    the gift of the Holy Ghost is the extent to which they are sanctified.
                    In the lives of most of
                    us, sanctification is an ongoing process, and we obtain that glorious
                    status by degrees as we overcome the world and become saints in deed as
                    well as in name.

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The close
                    relationship between partaking of the sacrament and the companionship
                    of the Holy Ghost is explained in the revealed prayer on the sacrament.
                    In
                    partaking of the bread, we witness that we are willing to take upon us
                    the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him and keep His
                    commandments. When
                    we do so, we have the promise that we will always have His Spirit to be
                    with us (see D&amp;C 20:77).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>To have the
                    continuous companionship of the Holy Ghost is the most precious
                    possession we can have in mortality. The <em>gift</em> of the Holy
                    Ghost was conferred
                    upon us by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood after our
                    baptism. But to realize the blessings of that gift, we must keep
                    ourselves free from sin. When
                    we commit sin, we become unclean and the Spirit of the Lord withdraws
                    from us. The Spirit of the Lord does not dwell in "unholy temples" (see
                    Mosiah
                    2:36-37; Alma 34:35-36; Hel. 4:24), and no unclean thing can dwell in
                    His presence </big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>(see Eph. 5:5; 1
                    Ne. 10:21; Alma 7:21; Moses 6:57).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>A few weeks ago
                    I used a chain saw to cut down a tree in my backyard. It was a dirty
                    job, and when I was done I was splattered with a filthy mixture of
                    sawdust
                    and oil. In that condition I did not want anyone to see me. I just
                    wanted to be cleansed in water so I would again feel comfortable in the
                    presence of other
                    people.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Not one of you
                    young men and not one of your leaders has lived without sin since his
                    baptism. Without some provision for further cleansing after our
                    baptism,
                    each of us is lost to things spiritual. We cannot have the
                    companionship of the Holy Ghost, and at the final judgment we would be
                    bound to be "cast off
                    forever" (1 Ne. 10:21). How grateful we are that the Lord has provided
                    a process for each baptized member of His Church to be periodically
                    cleansed from the
                    soil of sin. The sacrament is an essential part of that process.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>We are commanded
                    to repent of our sins and to come to the Lord with a brokenheart and a
                    contrite spirit and partake of the sacrament in compliance with its
                    covenants. When we renew our baptismal covenants in this way, the Lord
                    renews the cleansing effect of our baptism. In this way we are made
                    clean and can
                    always have His Spirit to be with us. The importance of this is evident
                    in the Lord's commandment that we partake of the sacrament each week
                    (see D&amp;C
                    59:8-9).</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>We cannot
                    overstate the importance of the Aaronic Priesthood in this. All of
                    these vital steps pertaining to the remission of sins are performed
                    through the
                    saving ordinance of baptism and the renewing ordinance of the
                    sacrament. ...</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The Aaronic
                    Priesthood holds the keys of the "gospel of repentance and of baptism,
                    and the remission of sins" (D&amp;C 84:27). The cleansing power of our
                    Savior's Atonement is renewed for us as we partake of the sacrament.
