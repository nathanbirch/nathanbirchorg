                    Gethsemane that Jesus took on Himself the sins of the world, in
                    Gethsemane that His pain was equivalent to the cumulative burden of all
                    men, in
                    Gethsemane that He descended below all things so that all could repent

                            beneath
                            this concentrated load, this intense, incomprehensible pressure, this
                            terrible exaction of Divine justice, from which feeble humanity shrank,
                            and through the agony thus experienced sweating great drops of blood,
                            He was led to exclaim, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
                            from me." He had
                            wrestled with the superincumbent load in the wilderness, He had
                            struggled against the powers of darkness that had been let loose upon
                            him there; placed below
                            all things, His mind surcharged with agony and pain, lonely and
                            apparently helpless and forsaken, in his agony and the blood oozed from
                            His pores. Thus
                            rejected by His own, attacked by the powers of darkness, and seemingly
                            forsaken by His God, on the cross He bowed beneath the accumulated
                            load, and cried
                            out in anguish, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!" When death
                            approached to relieve Him from His horrible position, a ray of hope
                            appeared
                            through the abyss of darkness with which He had been surrounded, and in
                            a spasm of relief, seeing the bright future beyond, He said, "It is
                            finished! Father,
                            into thy hands I commend my spirit." As a God, He descended below all
                            things, and made Himself subject to man in man's fallen condition; as a
                            man, He
                            grappled with all the circumstances incident to His sufferings in the
                            world. Anointed, indeed, with the oil of gladness above His fellows, He
                            struggled with and
                            overcame the powers of men and devils, of earth and hell combined; and
                            aided by this superior power of the Godhead, He vanquished death, hell
                            and the grave,
                            and arose triumphant as the Son of God, the very eternal Father, the
                            Messiah, the Prince of peace, the Redeemer, the Savior of the world;
                            having finished and
                            completed the work pertaining to the atonement, which His Father had
                            given Him to do as the Son of God and the Son of man. As the Son of
                            Man, He endured
                            all that it was possible for flesh and blood to endure, as the Son of
                            God He triumphed over all, and forever ascended to the right hand of
                            God, to further carry
                            out the designs of Jehovah pertaining to the world and to the human

                            Brigham Young spoke of what evoked the "why" from Jesus, saying that
                            during the axis of agony which was
                            Gethsemane and Calvary, the Father at some point withdrew both His
                            presence and His Spirit from Jesus (see <em>Journal of
                                Discourses</em> 3:205-6). Thereby Jesus' personal triumph was complete
                            and His empathy perfected. Having "descended
                            below all things," He comprehends, perfectly and personally, the full
                            range of human suffering! (D&amp;C 88:6; see D&amp;C 122:8).
                            A spiritual sung in yesteryear has an especially moving and insightful
                            line: "Nobody knows the troubles I've seen, nobody
                            knows but Jesus" (see also Alma 7:11-12). Truly, Jesus was exquisitely
                            "acquainted with grief," as no one else (Isa. 53:3).
