                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>I am sorry to
                    say that I have heard of some members of the Church saying that Christ
                    did not buy us with his blood. One of them has said: "That people of
                    the
                    world owed a debt and Jesus paid the debt for all: This thought does
                    violence to justice, for the suffering of the good to pay the debt of
                    the bad is contrary to the
                    law of life." Another says: "That Jesus was a ransom for a captive
                    world: In this case Jesus must have been paid to someone who held the
                    world captive; but in
                    the very nature of his mission or ransom he could not be held captive
                    and God must have deceived the captor."</big></p>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big style="font-family: arial;">Well,
                        such thoughts as these might do honor to an infidel, but not to a
                        member of the Church. Those who speak this way need to repent. They
                        should read the
                        scriptures and especially the Book of Mormon. Jesus did come into the
                        world to ransom it. Through his atonement we were bought from death and
                        hell. Death
                        and hell were paid -- paid in full -- and Christ was the only one who
                        could pay that debt. What did Paul mean when he said we were bought
                        with a price?" [1
                        Cor. 6:20; 7:23.] What does Jesus mean when he calls himself our
                        "Redeemer?" [Isa. 41:14; D. &amp; C. 8:1; Rev. 5:9-10.] If we were not
                        bought, if we were not
                        ransomed by Jesus Christ, then we are still in our sins and still
                        subject to death and hell. These men, ignorant of the plan of
                        salvation, should read intensively
                        the scriptures. (<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, 1:125-126)<br>

                    </big></div>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big style="font-family: arial;">Our
                        Redeemer has done everything that is essential for our salvation, and
                        he has taught us that if we serve him with all our soul, and all our
                        days, yet we are
                        unprofitable servants and have done only that which it was our duty to
                        do. Paul says we were bought with a price, and we are not our own. Our
                        Redeemer has a
                        perfect right to command us, and all that we do is for our own sakes.
                        He can do without us, but we cannot do without him. We are told that we
                        are unprofitable
                        servants, and so we are, if we think of trying to pay our Savior back
                        for what he has done for us, for that we never can do; and we cannot by
                        any number of acts,
                        or a full life of faithful service, place our Savior in our debt. (<em>Doctrines
                            of Salvation</em>, 1:15)</big><br>

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>You cannot with
                    impunity "crucify Christ afresh."[see Heb. 6:6] "Flee fornication," [1
                    Cor. 6:18] Paul cries, and flee "<em>anything like unto it</em>,"
                    [D&amp;C 59:6;
                    emphasis added] the Doctrine and Covenants adds. Why? Well, for one
                    reason because of the incalculable suffering in both body and spirit
                    endured by the
                    Savior of the world so that we <em>could</em> flee. [see especially
                    D&amp;C 19:15-20] We owe Him something for that. Indeed, we owe Him
                    everything for that. "Ye are not
                    your own," Paul says. "Ye [have been] bought with a price: therefore <em>glorify
                        God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's</em>." [1 Cor.
                    6:19-20; emphasis
                    added; see also 1 Cor. 6:13-18] (From ["Personal Purity," <em>Ensign</em>,
