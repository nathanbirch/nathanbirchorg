                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>From the facts
                    in the case and the testimony presented in the Scriptures it becomes
                    evident that through the great atonement, the expiatory sacrifice of
                    the Son
                    of God, it is made possible that man can be redeemed, restored,
                    resurrected and exalted to the elevated position designed for him in
                    the creation as a Son of
                    God: that eternal justice and law required the penalty to be paid by
                    man himself, or by the atonement of the Son of God: that Jesus offered
                    Himself as the great
                    expiatory sacrifice; that this offering being in accordance with the
                    demands or requirements of the law, was accepted by the great Lawgiver;
                    that it was
                    prefigured by sacrifices, and ultimately fulfilled by Himself according
                    to the eternal covenant. "He was wounded (as prophesied of) for our
                    transgressions, he
                    was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon
                    him, and with his stripes we are healed."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>The Savior thus
                    becomes master of the situation--the debt is paid, the redemption made,
                    the covenant fulfilled, justice satisfied, the will of God done, and
                    all
                    power is now given into the hands of the Son of God--the power of the
                    resurrection, the power of the redemption, the power of salvation, the
                    power to enact
                    laws for the carrying out and accomplishment of this design. Hence life
                    and immortality are brought to light, the Gospel is introduced. and He
                    becomes the
                    author of eternal life and exaltation, He is the Redeemer, the
                    Resurrector, the Savior of man and the world; and He has appointed the
                    law of the Gospel as the
                    medium which must be complied with in this world or the next, as He
                    complied with His Father's law; hence "he that believeth shall be
                    saved, and he that
                    believeth not shall be damned"</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>The plan, the
                    arrangement, the agreement, the covenant was made, entered into and
                    accepted before the foundation of the world; it was prefigured by
                    sacrifices,
                    and was carried out and consummated on the cross.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>Hence being the
                    mediator between God and man, He becomes by right the dictator and
                    director on earth and in heaven for the living and for the dead, for
                    the
                    past, the present and the future, pertaining to man as associated with
