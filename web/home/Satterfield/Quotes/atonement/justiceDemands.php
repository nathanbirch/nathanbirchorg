                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Adam's
                    transgression brought these two deaths: spiritual and temporal--man
                    being banished from the presence of God, and also becoming mortal and
                    subject
                    to all the ills of the flesh. In order that he should be brought back
                    again, there had to be a reparation of the broken law. Justice demanded
                    it.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>The fall brought
                    death. That is not a desirable condition. We do not want to be banished
                    from the presence of God. We do not want to be subject forever to
                    mortal conditions. We do not want to die and have our bodies turn to
                    dust, and the spirits that possess these bodies by right, turned over
                    to the realm of Satan
                    and become subject to him.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>But that was the
                    condition; and if Christ had not come as the atoning sacrifice, in
                    demand of the law of justice, to repair or to atone or to redeem us
                    from the
                    condition that Adam found himself in, and that we find ourselves in;
                    then mortal death would have come; the body would have gone back to the
                    dust from
                    where it came; the spirit would have gone into the realms of Satan's
                    domain, and have been subject to him forever. Justice demanded that the
                    law which was
                    broken be repaired. Justice demanded that by the giving of life Adam
                    and his posterity will be brought back into the presence of God. (<em>Doctrines
                        of Salvation</em>,
