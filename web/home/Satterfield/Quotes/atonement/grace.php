                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>It is only
                    through the infinite Atonement of Jesus Christ that people can overcome
                    the consequences of bad choices. Thus Nephi teaches us that it is
                    ultimately
                    by the grace of Christ that we are saved even after all that we can do
                    (see 2 Ne. 25:23). No matter how hard we work, no matter how much we
                    obey, no matter
                    how many good things we do in this life, it would not be enough were it
                    not for Jesus Christ and His loving grace. On our own we cannot earn
                    the kingdom of
                    God-no matter what we do. Unfortunately, there are some within the
                    Church who have become so preoccupied with performing good works that
                    they forget
                    that those works--as good as they may be--are hollow unless they are
                    accompanied by a complete dependence on Christ. It is this dependence
                    that causes us to
                    want to sing what Alma eloquently referred to as "the song of redeeming
                    love" (Alma 5:26). ["Building Bridges of Understanding," <em>Ensign</em>,
                    June 1998, p. 65]</big><br style="font-family: arial;" wp="BR2">

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>By yielding to
                    the temptation of Satan we become unclean. To the extent to which we
                    yield we become carnal, sensual, and devilish. As a consequence, we are
                    banished from the presence of God. Without being cleansed from the
                    stain of our transgressions we cannot be readmitted into the presence
                    of God because "no
                    unclean thing can enter into his kingdom." (3 Ne. 27:19.) Men, in the
                    exercise of their own free agency, having disqualified themselves for a
                    place in the
                    kingdom of God, are banished therefrom and cannot by their own unaided
                    efforts return. If they are ever to return, atonement for their sins
                    must be made by
                    someone not himself banished: Jesus was that one. ("Christ's Atonement:
                    The Gift Supreme," <em>Ensign</em>, Dec. 1973, p.3)</big><br

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>Jesus Christ
                    possessed merits that no other child of Heavenly Father could possibly
                    have. He was a God, Jehovah, before His birth in Bethlehem. His Father
                    not
                    only gave Him His spirit body, but Jesus was His Only Begotten Son in
                    the flesh. Our Master lived a perfect, sinless life and therefore was
                    free from the
                    demands of justice. He was and is perfect in every attribute, including
                    love, compassion, patience, obedience, forgiveness, and humility. His
                    mercy pays our
                    debt to justice when we repent and obey Him. Even with our best efforts
                    to obey His teachings we will still fall short, yet because of His
                    grace we will be saved
                    "after all we can do." ( "Jesus Christ, Our Redeemer," <em>Ensign</em>,
                    May 1997, p. 53)</big></p>
