                    When his body was taken from the cross and hastily placed in a borrowed

                    the sins and temptations of every human soul who will repent, but all
                    of our sickness and grief and pain of every kind. He suffered these
                    afflictions as we suffer
                    them, according to the flesh. He suffered them all. He did this to
                    perfect his mercy and his ability to lift us above every earthly trial.

                    hours that comprised Gethsemane and Calvary and also the period just
                    before. ...</big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big>While weary and
                    worried Apostles slept, in Gethsemane Jesus began to be "sore amazed"
                    (Mark 14:33), or in the Greek rendition, "awestruck" and
                    "astonished" and "very heavy" as the Psalmist had foretold. (See Ps.
                    69:20-21.)</big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big>Jesus, Creator
                    and Jehovah, surely had known for a long time what He must do.
                    Nevertheless, He had never known, personally, the exquisite and
                    exacting
                    process of an atonement before. And it was so much worse than even He
                    with His unique intellect had ever imagined. No wonder an angel
                    appeared to
                    strengthen Him! (See Luke 22:43.)</big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big>No wonder He
                    began to be "very heavy" or, also in the Greek rendition, very
                    "dejected" and "depressed" and filled with anguish. The cumulative
                    weight of all
                    mortal sins, somehow, past, present, and future, pressed upon that
                    perfect, sinless, and sensitive soul! All infirmities and sicknesses
                    were part, too, of the awful
                    arithmetic of the Atonement. (See Alma 7:11, 12; Isa. 53:3-5; Matt.
                    8:17.)</big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big>"And he said,
                    Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup
                    from me." (Mark 14:36.) It was the cry of a Child, in deep distress,
                    for His
                    Father.</big></p>
                <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><big style="font-family: arial;">As
                        Jehovah, Jesus had said to Abraham: "Is any thing too hard for the
                        Lord?" (Gen. 18:14.) Jesus had taught this very truth about what was
                        feasible for
                        believers in His mortal ministry. Had not an angel told a perplexed
                        Mary about her own impending miracle, saying, "For with God nothing
                        shall be
                        impossible"? (Luke 1:37.) And so in His anguish, Jesus actually pled
                        that the hour and cup might pass from Him. In His anguish, He even
                        quoted back to the
                        Father those special, significant words--"All things are possible unto
                        thee; take away this cup from me." (See Matt. 16:26; 26:39.) This was
                        not theater--this
                        was shuddering reality! Did the Lamb, in this extremity, hope for a ram
                        in the thicket? I do not know, but the suffering was enormously
                        multiplied by infinity.
                        His soul-cries are understandable. ("The New Testament--A Matchless

                    empathy was ensured when, along with His Atonement for our sins, He
                    took upon Himself our sicknesses, sorrows, griefs, and infirmities and
                    came to know these "according to the flesh" (Alma 7:11-12). He did this
                    in order that He might be filled with perfect, personal mercy and
                    empathy and thereby
                    know how to succor us in our infirmities. He thus fully comprehends
                    human suffering. ("Enduring Well," <em>Ensign</em>, Apr. 1997, p. 7)<br>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big>When Jesus took
                    upon Himself the heavy, atoning yoke in order to redeem all mankind by
                    paying the agonizing price for our sins, He thereby experienced what
                    He Himself termed the "fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God"
                    (D&amp;C 76:107). The phrase itself makes the soul tremble. Jesus also
                    volunteered to take upon
                    Himself additional agony in order that He might experience and thus
                    know certain things "according to the flesh," namely human sicknesses
                    and infirmities and
                    human griefs, including those not associated with sin (see Alma
                    7:11-12). Therefore, as a result of His great Atonement, Jesus was
                    filled with unique empathy
                    and with perfect mercy. ("Becoming a Disciple," <em>Ensign</em>, June

                <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><big style="font-family: arial;">Jesus
                        thus not only satisfied the requirements of divine justice but also,
                        particularly in His Gethsemane and Calvary ordeals, demonstrated and
                        perfected His
                        capacity to succor His people and his empathy for them. He came to
                        know, personally and perfectly, "according to the flesh" how to help us
                        become more like
                        His fully comprehending Father: "Great is our Lord, and of great power:
                        his understanding is infinite" (Psalm 147:5). Jesus' daily mortal
                        experiences and His
                        ministry, to be sure, acquainted Him by observation with a sample of
                        human sicknesses, grief, pains, sorrows, and infirmities which are
                        "common to man' (1
                        Corinthians 10:13). But the agonies of the Atonement were infinite and
                        first-hand! Since not all human sorrow and pain is connected to sin,
                        the full
                        intensiveness of the Atonement involved bearing our pains, infirmities,
                        and sicknesses, as well as our sins. Whatever our sufferings, we can
                        safely cast our care
                        upon him; for he careth for [us]" (1 Peter 5:7). Jesus is a fully
                        comprehending Christ. (From <em>Not My Will, But Thine</em>, p.51)<br>

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>It seems that no
                    matter how carefully we walk through life's paths, we pick up some
                    thorns, briars, and slivers. ...</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>How are the
                    thorns and slivers of life removed? The power to remove the thorns in
                    our lives and in the lives of others begins with ourselves. Moroni
                    writes that
                    when we deny ourselves of ungodliness, then the grace of Christ is
                    sufficient for us. (See Moro. 10:32.)</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Too often we
                    seek bandages to cover the guilt rather than removal of the thorn
                    causing the pain. How much we resist the momentary pain of removing a
                    sliver,
                    even though it will relieve the longer-lasting pain of a festering
                    sore. Everyone knows that if thorns and briars and slivers are not
                    removed from the flesh, they
                    will cause sores that fester and will not heal. ...</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>As a carpenter,
                    Jesus would have been familiar with slivers and thorny woods. As a
                    child, He would have learned that one rarely gets a sliver when working
                    the
                    wood in the right direction. He would also have known more than any how
                    slivers--small and painful--divert attention from important matters.
                    The scourging
                    of Jesus took place partly with thorns:</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big> "Then the
                    soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered
                    unto him the whole band of soldiers.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>"And they
                    stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>"And when they
                    had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in
                    his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him,
                    saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>"And they spit
                    upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head." (Matt.
                    27:27-30.)</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big>Perhaps this
                    cruel act was a perverse attempt to mimic the placing of an emperor's
                    laurel upon His head. Thus, there was pressed down upon Him a crown of
                    thorns. He accepted the pain as part of the great gift He had promised
                    to make. How poignant this was, considering that thorns signified God's
                    displeasure as
                    He cursed the ground for Adam's sake that henceforth it would bring
                    forth thorns. But by wearing the crown, Jesus transformed thorns into a
                    symbol of His
                    glory. ...</big></p>
