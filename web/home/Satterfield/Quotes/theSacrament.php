                                        and ratified. Thus baptism is called
                                        a sacrament, for by it persons are separated from the world, brought
                                        into Christ's visible church, and laid under particular obligations to
                                        obey his precepts. The eucharist or
                                        communion of the Lord's supper, is also a sacrament, for by
                                        commemorating the death and dying love of Christ, christians avow their
                                        special relation to him, and renew
                                        their obligations to be faithful to their divine Master. When we use
                                        sacrament without any qualifying word, we mean by it the eucharist or
                                        Lord's supper. </big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        prepare themselves to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament. In
                                        a worldwide leadership training meeting five years
                                        ago, Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
                                        taught the priesthood leaders of the Church how to plan and conduct
                                        sacrament meetings. "We
                                        commemorate His Atonement in a very personal way," Elder Nelson said.
                                        "We bring a broken heart and a contrite spirit to our sacrament
                                        meeting. It is the highlight of our
                                        Sabbath-day observance" ("Worshiping at Sacrament Meeting," <em>Liahona</em>,

                                        "During that quiet interval, prelude music is subdued. This is not a

                                        period of prayerful meditation as leaders and members prepare
                                        spiritually for the sacrament" (<em>Liahona</em>, Aug. 2004, 13; <em>Ensign</em>,

                                        following His Resurrection, He taught them that they should stop the
                                        practice of sacrifice by the shedding of blood. Instead, "ye
                                        shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite
                                        spirit" (3 Nephi 9:20). That commandment, repeated in the modern
                                        revelation directing us to partake of the
                                        sacrament each week, tells us how we should prepare. As Elder Nelson
                                        taught, "Each member of the Church bears responsibility for the
                                        spiritual enrichment that can come
                                        from a sacrament meeting" (<em>Liahona</em>, Aug. 2004, 14; <em>Ensign</em>,

                                        salvation, President Joseph Fielding Smith teaches that we partake of
                                        the sacrament as our part of commemorating the Savior's death
                                        and sufferings for the redemption of the world. This ordinance was
                                        introduced so that we can renew our covenants to serve Him, to obey
                                        Him, and to always remember
                                        Him. President Smith adds: "We cannot retain the Spirit of the Lord if
                                        we do not consistently comply with this commandment" (<em>Doctrines of
                                            Salvation</em>, comp. Bruce R.

                                        attitude and preparation for any activity in which we will engage. If
                                        we are going swimming or hiking or playing on the beach,
                                        our clothing, including our footwear, will indicate this. The same
                                        should be true of how we dress when we are to participate in the
                                        ordinance of the sacrament. It is like going
                                        to the temple. Our manner of dress indicates the degree to which we
                                        understand and honor the ordinance in which we will participate.</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                                                   size="-1"><big><big><big>During sacrament meeting-and especially
                                        during the sacrament service-we should concentrate on worship and
                                        refrain from all other activities, especially from behavior that
                                        could interfere with the worship of others. Even a person who slips
                                        into quiet slumber does not interfere with others. Sacrament meeting is
                                        not a time for reading books or
                                        magazines. Young people, it is not a time for whispered conversations
                                        on cell phones or for texting persons at other locations. When we
                                        partake of the sacrament, we make
                                        a sacred covenant that we will always remember the Savior. How sad to
                                        see persons obviously violating that covenant in the very meeting where
                                        they are making it.</big></big></big></font><font face="Arial" size="-2"><big><big><big>

                                        also gave teachings and promises about the Holy Ghost. On that sacred
                                        occasion known as the Last Supper, Jesus
                                        explained the mission of the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. The
                                        Comforter would testify of Him and reveal other truths. Jesus also
                                        explained that He had to leave His
                                        disciples in order for the Comforter to come to them. When I depart, He
                                        told them, "I will send him unto you" (John 16:7). After His
                                        Resurrection, He told His Apostles to
                                        tarry in Jerusalem until they were given "power from on high" (Luke
                                        24:49). That power came when "the promise of the Holy Ghost" was "shed
                                        forth" upon the Apostles on
                                        the day of Pentecost (see Acts 2:33).</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        sacrament in the New World, He promised, "He that eateth this bread
                                        eateth of my body to his soul; and he that drinketh of this
                                        wine drinketh of my blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger
                                        nor thirst, but shall be filled" (3 Ne. 20:8). The meaning of that
                                        promise is evident: "Now, when the
                                        multitude had all eaten and drunk, behold, they were filled with the
                                        Spirit" (3 Ne. 20:9).</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        the revealed prayer on the sacrament. In partaking of
                                        the bread, we witness that we are willing to take upon us the name of
                                        Jesus Christ and always remember Him and keep His commandments. When we
                                        do so, we have the
                                        promise that we will always have His Spirit to be with us (see D&amp;C

                                        Holy Ghost is the most precious possession we can have in mortality.
                                        The gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred upon us by
                                        the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood after our baptism. But to
                                        realize the blessings of that gift, we must keep ourselves free from
                                        sin. When we commit sin, we
                                        become unclean and the Spirit of the Lord withdraws from us. The Spirit
                                        of the Lord does not dwell in "unholy temples" (see Mosiah 2:36-37;
                                        Alma 34:35-36; Hel. 4:24), and
                                        no unclean thing can dwell in His presence (see Eph. 5:5; 1 Ne. 10:21;
                                        Alma 7:21; Moses 6:57).</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        cleansed in water so I would again feel comfortable in the presence of
                                        other people.</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        for further cleansing after our baptism, each of us is
                                        lost to things spiritual. We cannot have the companionship of the Holy
                                        Ghost, and at the final judgment we would be bound to be "cast off
                                        forever" (1 Ne. 10:21). How
                                        grateful we are that the Lord has provided a process for each baptized
                                        member of His Church to be periodically cleansed from the soil of sin.
                                        The sacrament is an essential
                                        part of that process.</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        of the sacrament in compliance with its covenants.
                                        When we renew our baptismal covenants in this way, the Lord renews the
                                        cleansing effect of our baptism. In this way we are made clean and can
                                        always have His Spirit to
                                        be with us. The importance of this is evident in the Lord's commandment
                                        that we partake of the sacrament each week (see D&amp;C 59:8-9).</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        begins with the words, "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed by thy
                                        name." (Matt. 6:9.) From Sinai came the
                                        commandment, "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
                                        vain." (Ex. 20:7, Deut. 5:11.) Latter-day revelation equates this with
                                        using the name of God without
                                        authority. "Let all men beware how they take my name in their lips,"
                                        the Lord declares in a modern revelation, for "many there be who ...
                                        use the name of the Lord, and use
                                        it in vain, having not authority." (D&amp;C 63:61-62.)</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        scriptures that refer to "the name of Jesus Christ" are obviously
                                        references to the authority of the Savior. This was surely the
                                        meaning conveyed when the seventy reported to Jesus that "even the
                                        devils are subject unto us through thy name." (Luke 10:17.) The
                                        Doctrine and Covenants employs
                                        this same meaning when it describes the Twelve Apostles of this
                                        dispensation as "they who shall desire to take upon them my name with
                                        full purpose of heart." (D&amp;C
                                        18:27.) The Twelve are later designated as "special witnesses of the
                                        name of Christ in all the world," and as those who "officiate in the

                                        their God would "cause his name to dwell." (Deut. 12:11; see also Deut.
                                        14:23-24; Deut. 16:6.) Time after time in succeeding revelations, the
                                        Lord and his servants referred
                                        to the future temple as a house for "the name" of the Lord God of
                                        Israel. (See 1 Kgs. 3:2; 1 Kgs. 5:5; 1 Kgs. 8:16-20, 29, 44, 48; 1 Chr.

                                        appeared to Solomon and told him that He had hallowed the temple "to
                                        put my name there for ever." (1
                                        Kgs. 9:3; 2 Chr. 7:16.)</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        of the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet Joseph Smith asked the Lord for a

                                        something far more significant than a mere inscription of his
                                        sacred name on the structure. The scriptures speak of the Lord's
                                        putting his name in a temple because he gives authority for his name to
                                        be used in the sacred ordinances
                                        of that house. That is the meaning of the Prophet's reference to the
                                        Lord's putting his name upon his people in that holy house. (See

                                        numerous instances where an angel appeared personally. Angelic
                                        appearances to Zacharias and Mary (see Luke 1) and to King Benjamin and
                                        Nephi, the grandson of

                                        they had "seen an angel," (2) they had "heard his voice

                                        scriptures contain many other statements that angels are sent to teach
                                        the gospel and bring men to Christ (see Heb. 1:14; Alma 39:19; Moro.

                                        companionship and communication are only available to those who are
                                        clean. As explained earlier, through the Aaronic Priesthood
                                        ordinances of baptism and the sacrament, we are cleansed of our sins
                                        and promised that if we keep our covenants we will always have His
                                        Spirit to be with us. I believe
                                        that promise not only refers to the Holy Ghost but also to the
                                        ministering of angels, for "angels speak by the power of the Holy
                                        Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of
                                        Christ" (2 Ne. 32:3). So it is that those who hold the Aaronic
                                        Priesthood open the door for all Church members who worthily partake of
                                        the sacrament to enjoy the
                                        companionship of the Spirit of the Lord and the ministering of angels. </big></big></big></font><font

                                        thoughtful nurses I express my deepest gratitude, and for the
                                        thoughtful letters and messages of faith and hope received from many
                                        places in the world, many expressing,
                                        "You have been in our prayers" or "We have been asking our Heavenly
                                        Father to spare your life." Your prayers and mine, thankfully, have
                                        been answered. ...</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>

                                        followed, there was impressed again and again upon my

                                        Passover supper, He instructed and prepared the
                                        sacrament of the Lord's Supper for His dearest friends as a remembrance
                                        of His coming sacrifice. It was so impressively portrayed to me--the

                                        Savior for each. I witnessed His thoughtful concern for significant
                                        details--the washing of the dusty feet of each Apostle, His breaking
                                        and blessing of the loaf of dark bread
                                        and blessing of the wine, then His dreadful disclosure that one would

                                        upon Himself the burden of the sins of mankind from Adam to the end of
                                        the world. His agony in the garden, Luke tells us, was so intense "his

                                        of blood falling &#8230; to the ground." (Luke 22:44.) He suffered an agony
                                        and a burden the like of which no human person would be able to bear.

                                        struggling up the hill in His
                                        weakened condition carrying the cross and His being stretched upon it
                                        as it lay on the ground, that the crude spikes could be driven with a
                                        mallet into His hands and wrists
                                        and feet to secure His body as it hung on the cross for public display.</big></big></big></font></big></big></big></p>
