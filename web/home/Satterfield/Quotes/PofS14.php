                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><font face="Arial" size="+1"><big>It
                        is written of the Saviour that he descended below all things. If he did
                        he descended in capacity. I will merely tell you what
                        I believe on this point. I believe that there never was a child born on
                        this earth with any less capacity than dwelt in the child
                        that was born in a manger of his mother Mary. I believe, according to
                        the natural ability which he received from his mother
                        and from his supposed father Joseph, that there never was a child that
                        descended lower in capacity, or that knew less. Yet, according to the
                        history given of him, his power of mind developed with such wonderful
                        rapidity that when he was but a
                        few years old he propounded questions to the learned doctors of his day
                        which they could not answer, and answered
                        questions propounded to him which the querists could not answer. He
                        increased in wisdom and knowledge, and came into
                        communication with his Father. The Being whom we call Father was the
                        Father of the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
                        he was also his Father pertaining to the flesh. Infidels and
                        Christians, make all you can of this statement. The Bible, which
                        all Christians profess to believe, reveals that fact, and it reveals
                        the truth upon that point, and I am a witness of its truth. The
                        Apostles who were personally acquainted with Jesus Christ did know and
                        understand what they wrote, and they wrote
                        the truth. (<em>Journal of Discourses</em>, 7:286)</big></font></big></p>

                        object of man's taking a body is, that through the redemption of Jesus
                        Christ, both soul and body may be exalted in the
                        eternal world, when the earth shall be celestial, and to obtain a
                        higher exaltation than he would be capable of doing without
                        a body. For when man was first made, he was made "a little lower than
                        the angels," Heb. 2:7; but through the atonement
                        and resurrection of Jesus Christ, he is placed in a position to obtain
                        an exaltation higher than that of angels. Says the
                        Apostle, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?" 1 Cor. 6:3. "Jesus
                        descended below all things, that he might be raised
                        above all things." He took upon him a body, that he might die as a man,
                        and "that through death, he might destroy him that
                        had the power of death, that is, the Devil." Heb. 2:14. Having
                        conquered Death, then, in his own dominions, burst the
                        barriers of the tomb, and ascended with his body triumphant to the
                        right hand of God, he has accomplished a purpose
                        which God had decreed from before the foundation of the world, "and
                        opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers."
                        Hence man, through obedience to the Gospel, is placed in a position to
                        be an adopted son of God, and have a legitimate
                        right to his Father's blessings, and to possess the gift of the Holy
                        Ghost. And the Apostle says, that "If the spirit of him that
                        raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
                        from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
                        his Spirit that dwelleth in you." Rom. 8:11. Thus, as Jesus vanquished
                        death, so may we; as he overcame, so may we; and,
                        if faithful, sit with him upon his throne, as he has overcome, and sat
                        down upon his Father's throne. Rev. 3:21. Thus, an will
                        not only be raised from degradation, but will also be exalted to a seat
                        among the intelligence which surround the throne of
                        God. This is one great object of our coming here and taking bodies. (<em>The
                            Government of God</em>, Ch.5)</big></font></big></p>

                        <font face="Arial" size="+1"><big>Groaning beneath this concentrated
                            load, this intense, incomprehensible pressure, this terrible exaction
                            of Divine justice,
                            from which feeble humanity shrank, and through the agony thus
                            experienced sweating great drops of blood, He was led to
                            exclaim, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me." He had
                            wrestled with the superincumbent load in the
                            wilderness, He had struggled against the powers of darkness that had
                            been let loose upon him there; placed below all
                            things, His mind surcharged with agony and pain, lonely and apparently
                            helpless and forsaken, in his agony and the blood
                            oozed from His pores. Thus rejected by His own, attacked by the powers
                            of darkness, and seemingly forsaken by His God,
                            on the cross He bowed beneath the accumulated load, and cried out in
                            anguish, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
                            me!" When death approached to relieve Him from His horrible position, a
                            ray of hope appeared through the abyss of
                            darkness with which He had been surrounded, and in a spasm of relief,
                            seeing the bright future beyond, He said, "It is
                            finished! Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." As a God, He
                            descended below all things, and made Himself
                            subject to man in man's fallen condition; as a man, He grappled with
                            all the circumstances incident to His sufferings in the
                            world. Anointed, indeed, with the oil of gladness above His fellows, He
                            struggled with and overcame the powers of men
                            and devils, of earth and hell combined; and aided by this superior
                            power of the Godhead, He vanquished death, hell and
                            the grave, and arose triumphant as the Son of God, the very eternal
                            Father, the Messiah, the Prince of peace, the
                            Redeemer, the Savior of the world; having finished and completed the
                            work pertaining to the atonement, which His Father
                            had given Him to do as the Son of God and the Son of man. As the Son of
                            Man, He endured all that it was possible for
                            flesh and blood to endure, as the Son of God He triumphed over all, and
                            forever ascended to the right hand of God, to
                            further carry out the designs of Jehovah pertaining to the world and to
                            the human family. ( <em>Mediation and Atonement</em>,

                        Lord has said concerning Jesus, that he descended below all things that
                        he might rise above all things, and
                        comprehend all things. No man descended lower than the Savior of the
                        world. Born in a stable, cradled in a manger, he
                        traveled from there to the cross through suffering, mingled with blood,
                        to a throne of grace; and in all his life there was
                        nothing of an earthly nature that seemed to be worth possessing. His
                        whole life was passed in poverty, suffering, pain,
                        affliction, labor, prayer, mourning and sorrow, until he gave up the
                        ghost on the cross. Still he was God's firstborn son and
                        the Redeemer of the world. The question might be asked why the Lord
                        suffered his Son to come here and to live and die
                        as he did. When we get into the spirit world, and the vail is
                        withdrawn, we shall then perhaps understand the whys and
                        wherefore of all these things. In the dispensations and providences of
                        God to man it seems that we are born to suffer pain,
                        affliction, sorrows and trials; this is what God has decreed that the
                        human family shall pass through; and if we make a right
                        use of this probation, the experience it brings will eventually prove a
                        great blessing to us, and when we receive immortality
                        and eternal life, exaltation, kingdoms, thrones, principalities and
                        powers with all the blessings of the fulness of the Gospel
                        of Christ, we shall understand and comprehend why we are called to pass
                        through a continual warfare during the few years

                        let us be careful. Let us realize our condition. Let us realize we are
                        here upon a mission. Let us realize that we will
                        be held responsible for the manner in which we will it. We should be
                        willing to sacrifice everything for the upbuilding of the
                        Kingdom of God. Any man who will seek to save his life and desert the
                        principles of the Gospel, is not worthy of eternal life. How many have
                        laid down their lives since the creation of the world for the sake of
                        the truth? Jesus Himself descended
                        below all things. He descended, I believe, lower than any other man
                        will be called to descend. Are we greater than Jesus? If we are called
                        upon to-day to lay down our lives, what of it? Is it not as well to die
                        for the Gospel's sake as to die for
                        anything else? A million of men, a few years ago, sacrificed their
                        lives for the honor of this nation. No matter what we may
                        be called to pass through, let us maintain our integrity to God. Where
                        is the man whose mind has been lit up by the
                        inspiration of God to comprehend the celestial kingdom, or the
                        celestial law, or the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who can bear
                        the idea of pursuing a course whereby he will be cut off from
                        inheriting the blessings for which he has hoped in the future? No, I
                        would rather die a thousand deaths than be deprived of these blessings.
                        We have a long time to live when we get
                        through here. There is all eternity before us. It will pay you, it will
                        pay me--no matter what comes, no matter what this
                        nation may do to oppress us--to be true and faithful to our covenants,
                        to our wives and children, to our God and to our
                        country; it will pay us to be faithful to the end. (<em>Journal of

                        was in Gethsemane that Jesus took on Himself the sins of the world, in
                        Gethsemane that His pain was equivalent to the
                        cumulative burden of all men, in Gethsemane that He descended below all
                        things so that all could repent and come to Him.

                        man cannot describe the breadth, the depth, the
                        height of the suffering of our Lord - nor His infinite love for us. (<em>Teachings

                        let me describe to you what faith in Jesus Christ means. Faith in Him
                        is more than mere acknowledgment that He
                        lives. It is more than professing belief. Faith in Jesus Christ
                        consists of complete reliance on Him. As God, He has infinite
                        power, intelligence, and love. There is no human problem beyond His
                        capacity to solve. Because He descended below all
                        things, He knows how to help us rise above our daily difficulties. (<em>Teachings

                    Brigham Young spoke of what evoked the "why" from Jesus, saying that
                    during the axis of agony which was
                    Gethsemane and Calvary, the Father at some point withdrew both His
                    presence and His Spirit from Jesus (see <em>Journal of
                        Discourses</em> 3:205-6). Thereby Jesus' personal triumph was complete
                    and His empathy perfected. Having "descended
                    below all things," He comprehends, perfectly and personally, the full
                    range of human suffering! (D&amp;C 88:6; see D&amp;C 122:8).
                    A spiritual sung in yesteryear has an especially moving and insightful
                    line: "Nobody knows the troubles I've seen, nobody
                    knows but Jesus" (see also Alma 7:11-12). Truly, Jesus was exquisitely
                    "acquainted with grief," as no one else (Isa. 53:3).
