                        unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day
                        of judgment." (D&amp;C 101:78; italics added.) ["Our Moral

                        meant to be a test to see if we will keep the commandments of God. (See
                        2 Ne. 2:5.) We are free to obey or to ignore the spirit and the
                        letter of the law. But the agency granted to man is a moral agency.
                        (See D&amp;C 101:78.) We are not free to break our covenants and escape
                        the
                        consequences. ("Covenants," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1990, p. 84)</font></big></big></p>

                        indebted to President Boyd K. Packer, who made us aware of the fact
                        that the term free agency appears nowhere in holy writ. Instead, the
                        scriptures generally speak of agency or free will, but when agency is
                        modified, it is referred to as "<em>moral agency</em>" (D&amp;C 101:78;
                        emphasis
                        added). Because the term <em>free agency</em> has been used by various
                        modern prophets, I use the terms <em>free agency</em> and <em>moral
                            agency</em>
                        interchangeably, aware that the latter term is more correct. ("Agency:

                        mock and deride, as did a man named Korihor, with these words recorded
                        in the Book of Mormon: "And thus ye lead away this
                        people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to
                        your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage,
                        that
                        ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst
                        not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights
                        and
                        privileges" (Alma 30:27).</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Korihor was
                        arguing, as men and women have falsely argued from the beginning of
                        time, that to take counsel from the servants of God is to
                        surrender God-given rights of independence. But the argument is false
                        because it misrepresents reality. When we reject the counsel which
                        comes from God, we do not choose to be independent of outside
                        influence. We choose another influence. We reject the protection of a
                        perfectly
                        loving, all-powerful, all-knowing Father in Heaven, whose whole
                        purpose, as that of His Beloved Son, is to give us eternal life, to
                        give us all that
                        He has, and to bring us home again in families to the arms of His love.
                        In rejecting His counsel, we choose the influence of another power,
                        whose purpose is to make us miserable and whose motive is hatred. We
                        have moral agency as a gift of God. Rather than the right to choose to
                        be free of influence, it is the inalienable right to submit ourselves
                        to whichever of those powers we choose. ("Finding Safety in Counsel," <em>Ensign</em>,

                        in the face of difficult choices was not for Adam and Eve alone (Moses
                        7:32; D&amp;C 101:78). There are blessings if we choose
                        aright and penalties if we choose wrongly. Therefore, attempting to
                        stand between friends and the consequences of their wrong choices is
                        not
                        realistic; it is not nearly as useful as being lovingly at their sides
                        before and when choices are being made. Men and women really are "free
                        to
                        choose" (2 Nephi 2:27), and we cannot and should not try to have it
                        otherwise. (<em>But for a Small Moment</em>, p.130)</font></big></big><br

                            D&amp;C 58:27-28] We should have the ambition, we should have the
                            desire, we should make up our minds that, so far as the Lord
                            Almighty has given to us talent, we will do our full share in the
                            battle of life. It should be a matter of pride that no man shall do
                            more than you will

                            upon the earth. That has been my ambition all my life--to do my full
                            share.

                        choice, has never been revoked, and it never will be. It is an eternal
                        principle <em>giving freedom of thought and action to every soul</em>.
                        No person, by any decree of the Father, has ever been compelled to do
                        good; no
                        person has ever been forced to do evil. <em>Each may act for himself</em>.
                        It was Satan's plan to destroy this agency and force men to do his
                        will. There
                        could be no satisfactory existence without this great gift. Men must
                        have the privilege to choose even to the extent that they may rebel
                        against
                        the divine decrees. Of course <em>salvation and exaltation must come
                            through the free will </em>without coercion and by individual merit in
                        order that
                        righteous rewards may be given and proper punishment be meted out to
                        the transgressor. Therefore, when the great day of the Lord shall
                        come, the wicked who have merited banishment from a righteous
                        government will be consumed, or the privilege of continuance on the
                        earth will
                        be denied. (<em>Answers to Gospel Questions</em>, 2:20; emphasis added)<br>

                        of the creature is free; this is a law of their existence and the Lord
                        cannot violate his own law; were he to do that, he would cease to
                        be God. He has placed life and death before his children, and it is for
                        them to choose. If they choose life, they receive the blessing of life;
                        if they
                        choose death, they must abide the penalty. This is a law which has
                        always existed from all eternity, and will continue to exist throughout
                        all the
                        eternities to come. Every intelligent being must have the power of
                        choice, and God brings forth the results of the acts of his creatures
                        to promote
                        his Kingdom and subserve his purposes in the salvation and exaltation

                        choice, has never been revoked, and it never will be. It is an eternal
                        principle <em>giving freedom of thought and action to every soul</em>.
                        No person, by any decree of the Father, has ever been compelled to do
                        good; no

                        It was Satan's plan to destroy this agency and force men to do his
                        will. There
                        could be no satisfactory existence without this great gift. Men must
                        have the privilege to choose even to the extent that they may rebel
                        against
                        the divine decrees. Of course <em>salvation and exaltation must come

                        righteous rewards may be given and proper punishment be meted out to
                        the transgressor. Therefore, when the great day of the Lord shall
                        come, the wicked who have merited banishment from a righteous
                        government will be consumed, or the privilege of continuance on the
                        earth will

                        more erudite training than yours and mine, have said things and done
                        things more startling, more ugly, more skeptical than you or I could
                        think
                        of. Millions have gone down the path you are entering. They have all
                        come to grief or will ultimately. Shall the violin say to Tony
                        Stradivarius,
                        "You did not make me"? Shall the created thing question the creator?

                        arguing, as men and women have falsely argued from the beginning of
                        time, that to take counsel from the servants of God is to
                        surrender God-given rights of independence. But the argument is false
                        because it misrepresents reality. When we reject the counsel which
                        comes from God, we do not choose to be independent of outside
                        influence. We choose another influence. We reject the protection of a
                        perfectly
                        loving, all-powerful, all-knowing Father in Heaven, whose whole
                        purpose, as that of His Beloved Son, is to give us eternal life, to
                        give us all that
                        He has, and to bring us home again in families to the arms of His love.
                        In rejecting His counsel, we choose the influence of another power,
                        whose purpose is to make us miserable and whose motive is hatred. We
                        have moral agency as a gift of God. Rather than the right to choose to
                        be free of influence, it is the inalienable right to submit ourselves
                        to whichever of those powers we choose. ("Finding Safety in Counsel," <em>Ensign</em>,

                        preparation, he
                        is free to withdraw. But once the powerful rocket fuel is ignited, he

                        can assign consequences solely on the basis of our innermost thoughts
                        and desires. There is no uncertainty in the administration of
                        this law. As Ammon taught King Lamoni, God "looketh down upon all the
                        children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the
                        heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning." (Alma

                        Paul warned the Hebrews that God "is a discerner of the thoughts and
                        intents of the heart," and "all things are naked and opened unto
                        the eyes of him." (Heb. 4:12-13.)</font></big></big></p>

                        words, God judges us not only for our acts, but also for the desires of
                        our hearts. He has said so again and again. This is a challenging
                        reality, but it is not surprising. Agency and accountability are
                        eternal principles. We exercise our free agency not only by what we do,
                        but also by
                        what we decide, or will, or desire. Restrictions on freedom can deprive
                        us of the power to do, but no one can deprive us of the power to will
                        or
                        desire. Accountability must therefore reach and attach consequences to
                        the desires of our hearts. ( "The Desires of Our Hearts," <em>Ensign</em>,

                        identities, and our agency, long before we came to this world. To some
                        that will be a new thought, but the Bible teaches clearly just such an
                        eternal view of life, a life stretching back before this world was and

                        ordained thee a prophet unto the nations." (Jer. 1:5.) At another time
                        God reminded Job that "all the sons of God shouted for joy" (Job 38:7)
                        before there was yet any man or woman on the earth God was creating.
                        The Apostle Paul taught that God the Father chose us "before the

                        birth. It happened in a great premortal existence where we
                        developed our identities and increased our spiritual capabilities by
                        exercising our agency and making important choices. We developed our
                        intelligence and learned to love the truth, and we prepared to come to
                        earth to continue our progress.</font></big></big></p>

                        in Heaven wanted our growth to continue in mortality and to be enhanced
                        by our freedom to choose and learn. He also wanted us to
                        exercise our faith and our will, especially with a new physical body to
                        master and control. But we know from both ancient and modern revelation
                        that Satan wished to deny us our independence and agency in that
                        now-forgotten moment long ago, even as he wishes to deny them this very
                        hour. Indeed, Satan violently opposed the freedom of choice offered by
                        the Father, so violently that John in the Revelation described "war in
                        heaven" (Rev. 12:7) over the matter. Satan would have coerced us, and
                        he would have robbed us of that most precious of gifts if he could: our
                        freedom to choose a divine future and the exaltation we all hope to
                        obtain.</font></big></big></p>

                        setting, a major milestone was passed, a monumental victory was won. As
                        a result, we would be allowed to continue to pursue what President

                        Later Christ himself would come to earth, President McKay noted, "to

                        led
                        to political bondage. This they did while living under a government
                        providing for the freest exercise of agency. "Their laws and their
                        governments," says the record, "were established by the voice of the
                        people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they who
                        chose good." Therefore, "they could not be governed by the law nor
                        justice, save it were to their destruction." (Hel. 5:2-3.) Under these
                        circumstances, they chose as rulers wicked men, who would certainly
                        destroy their political liberties, to replace righteous men who had in
                        the
                        past protected and preserved those liberties and would have continued
                        to do so in the future. ...</font></big></big></p>

                        to the loss of personal liberty through the misuse of free agency, our
                        daily lives are filled with tragic evidence. We see the alcoholic
                        with his craving for drink, the dope fiend in his frenzy, and worse,
                        the pervert with his irretrievable loss of manhood. Who will say that

                        an eternal principle. <em>However, the free agency possessed by any
                            one person is increased or diminished by the use to which he puts it.
                            Every

                            exercise his agency. The further one goes in the making of wrong
                            decisions in the exercise of free agency, the more difficult it is for
                            him to recover the lost ground. One can, by persisting long enough,
                            reach the
                            point of no return. He then becomes an abject slave. By the exercise of
                            his free agency, he has decreased the area in which he can act, almost

                        Joseph Smith was asked by a stranger visitor at Nauvoo, "How do you
                        govern these people, these Americans, these Britons, these
                        Scandinavians, these men from all parts of the world, all
                        nationalities, speaking different languages, having different customs
                        and
                        traditions,--how do you govern them, that they live together in peace,
                        with a common purpose, and in the spirit of unity?" The Prophet sagely
                        answered--and he never said a wiser thing--"I teach them correct
                        principles, and they govern themselves." That government in which the
                        people
                        can and do govern themselves by obedience to correct principles, is
                        manifestly superior to any government that depends upon one man's will.
                        The word of God declares, "It is a slothful servant who waits to be
                        commanded in all things." Even in a government where God might command
                        and direct in everything, the condition would be inferior to what it

                        and that is to do just what I read to you: keep the commandments of
                        Jesus
                        Christ. He has a perfect right to tell us so. We have no right to

                        what he
                        is--when the gospel of Jesus Christ is presented to him, he has no

                        compelled to
                        receive it, because our Father in heaven has given to everyone of us in
                        the Church and out, the gift of free agency. That free agency gives us
                        the privilege to accept and be loyal to our Lord's commandments, but it
                        has never given us the right to reject them. Every man who rejects the
                        commandments of our Father in heaven is rebellious. (<em>Conference

                        it in detail; I only want to refer to it. It happened many years ago
                        when I was perhaps not quite as young as you are now, and it had to do
                        with
                        my decision to follow that guide.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">I knew what
                        agency was and knew how important it was to be individual and to be
                        independent, to be free. I somehow knew there was one thing
                        the Lord would never take from me, and that was my free agency. I would
                        not surrender my agency to any being but to Him! I determined that I
                        would give Him the one thing that He would never take--my agency. I
                        decided, by myself, that from that time on I would do things His way.</font></big></big></p>

                        ask, why does God, if He truly loves his children, permit Satan to
                        tempt us and thereby jeopardize our chances to gain the best
                        experiences in mortality and return to enjoy eternal life in His
                        presence? The answer is given by a great prophet-teacher: "Wherefore,
                        the Lord
                        God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could
                        not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one
                        [which is evil] or the other [which is good]." (2 Nephi 2:16.) Think
                        about that for a moment. If there were no opposition to good, would
                        there be
                        any chance to exercise your agency or right to choose? To deny you that
                        privilege would be to deny you the opportunity to grow in knowledge,
                        experience, and power. God has given laws with penalties affixed so
                        that man might be made afraid of sin and be guided into paths of truth
                        and
                        duty. (See Alma 42:20.) [<em>Stand Ye In Holy Places</em>, p.219]</font></big></big></p>

                            enticement by the good on the one hand and by the evil on the other, or
                            to say it in the language of the scriptures, "... the forbidden fruit
                            in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other
                            being bitter."
                            This father further explained, "Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man
                            that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for
                            himself
                            save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other." (2

                        understand what is right and what is wrong, we are in a position to
                        exercise our freedom in making choices. In so doing, we must
                        stand accountable for our decisions, and we cannot escape the
                        inevitable consequences of these choices. Such freedom to exercise
                        moral
                        agency is essential in an environment where people have the highest
                        prospects for progress and development.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">By our very
                        endowment as children of an Eternal Father, we have had implanted
                        within our souls the urgency to be free. It is natural for us to
                        want to be accountable for our own fates, because there is a whispering
                        within us confirming that this accountability is absolutely essential
                        to the
                        attainment of our eternal destiny.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">The
                        existence of laws, regulations, and procedures has never been
                        sufficient to compel men to obedience. Productive obedience comes
                        through the exercise of free will. ...</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">... Today we
                        are being encouraged to accept greater responsibility for the
                        allocation of our time, for our spiritual development through personal
                        and family study of the gospel, and for giving loving Christian
                        service. We must be willing to respond to this new challenge. Our
                        willingness to
                        accept this added accountability will exert an influence that will
                        reach far beyond our Sunday worship service and religious life.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Unless we
                        retain a vibrant desire to be free, and unless we understand and
                        practice the principles that give life to essential freedoms, we have
                        little reason to hope they will endure. If we allow ourselves to accept
                        dependency and regulation and to cease valuing independence and
                        self-accountability, then we are vulnerable to the forces that destroy
                        freedom. If righteousness is judged primarily by the degree to which
                        one
                        responds to programmed activity, then a condition develops within which
                        opportunities for progress decline. The resulting tragedy affects the
                        mortal potential of man and has a profound effect on his eternal
                        possibilities as well.</font></big></big></p>

                        behavior cannot produce the level of spiritual development required to
                        qualify one for eternal life. A necessary range of freedom
                        and self-determination is essential to one's spiritual development.
                        With an understanding of correct principles and an intrinsic desire to
                        apply
                        them, one must be motivated within himself to do many good things of
                        his own free will; for, as the revelation says, the power is in him
                        wherein
                        he is an agent unto himself (see D&amp;C 58:27-28).</font></big></big></p>

                        preserving our freedom for self-determination, we cannot ignore the
                        need for carefully ordered structure and procedure within government or
                        any other organization. A careful balance must be maintained between
                        that which is ordered for the welfare of the group and that which is
                        reserved for the conscience and the incentive of the individual.</font></big></big></p>

                        necessary balance of freedom and restraint is essential to right
                        relationships within families and communities, and it cannot be ignored
                        in
                        our assignments within the Church.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">I have
                        pondered the injunctions that have come to us in recent months from
                        leaders of the Church to simplify and reduce the number of
                        programmed activities prescribed for the members. There seems to be a
                        sensitivity to the need for maintaining this essential balance. We have
                        heard increased emphasis given to the need for individual initiative
                        and accountability within families. In his concluding remarks at the
                        April 1979
                        general conference, President Kimball said:</font></big></big></p>

                        decisions needed for us to move forward, as a people, must be made by
                        the individual members of the Church. The major strides
                        which must be made by the Church will follow upon the major strides to
                        be made by us as individuals. &#8230; </font></big></big></p>

                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">I rejoice in
                        the spirit and intent of this instruction from a living prophet. I see
                        in it the purposeful effort to preserve our individual accountability
                        in
                        the context of our Church membership and religious life.</font></big></big></p>

                        of the Church exercise self-determination in their application of
                        gospel principles they need not relax in their compliance with
                        these principles. In fact, optimum progress can only occur when
                        conditions are ideal for it, and these conditions must include the
                        necessary
                        degree of freedom and self-accountability. Anything less will guarantee
                        stunted spiritual growth.</font></big></big></p>

                        great. The ideal cannot be achieved otherwise. Celestial attainment can

                        example in this message on "weightier" matters is the role of choice,
                        or agency.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Few
                        concepts have more potential to mislead us than the idea that choice,
                        or agency, is an ultimate goal. For Latter-day Saints, this potential
                        confusion is partly
                        a product of the fact that moral agency--the right to choose--is a
                        fundamental condition of mortal life. Without this precious gift of
                        God, the purpose of mortal
                        life could not be realized. To secure our agency in mortality we fought
                        a mighty contest the book of Revelation calls a "war in heaven." This
                        premortal contest
                        ended with the devil and his angels being cast out of heaven and being
                        denied the opportunity of having a body in mortal life (see Rev.
                        12:7-9).</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>But our war
                        to secure agency was won. The test in this postwar mortal estate is not
                        to secure choice but to use it--to choose good instead of evil so that
                        we can
                        achieve our eternal goals. In mortality, choice is a method, not a goal.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Of course,
                        mortals must still resolve many questions concerning what restrictions
                        or consequences should be placed upon choices. But those questions come
                        under the heading of freedom, not agency. Many do not understand that
                        important fact. We are responsible to use our agency in a world of
                        choices. It will not
                        do to pretend that our agency has been taken away when we are not free
                        to exercise it without unwelcome consequences.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Because
                        choice is a method, choices can be exercised either way on any <a
                            name="LPHit23"></a>matter, and our choices can serve any goal.
                        Therefore, those who consider freedom of
                        choice as a goal can easily slip into the position of trying to justify
                        any choice that is made. "Choice" can even become a slogan to justify
                        one particular choice.
                        For example, today one who says "I am pro-choice" is clearly understood
                        as opposing any legal restrictions upon a woman''s choice to abort a
                        fetus.</big></big></p>

                        been fascinated with
                        how cleverly those who sought and now defend legalized abortion on
                        demand have moved the issue away from a debate on the moral, ethical,
                        and medical pros
                        and cons of legal restrictions on abortion and focused the debate on
                        the slogan or issue of choice. The slogan or sound bite "pro-choice"
                        has had an almost
                        magical effect in justifying abortion and in neutralizing opposition to
                        it.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Pro-choice
                        slogans have been particularly seductive to Latter-day Saints because
                        we know that moral agency, which can be described as the power of
                        choice, is
                        a fundamental necessity in the gospel plan. All Latter-day Saints are
                        pro-choice according to that theological definition. But being
                        pro-choice on the need for
                        moral agency does not end the matter for us. Choice is a method, not
                        the ultimate goal. We are accountable for our choices, and only
                        righteous choices will
                        move us toward our eternal goals.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In this
                        effort, Latter-day Saints follow the teachings of the prophets. On this
                        subject our prophetic guidance is clear. The Lord commanded, "Thou
                        shalt not &#8230;
                        kill, nor do anything like unto it" (D&amp;C 59:6). The Church opposes
                        elective abortion for personal or social convenience. Our members are
                        taught that, subject
                        only to some very rare exceptions, they must not submit to, perform,
                        encourage, pay for, or arrange for an abortion. That direction tells us
                        what we need to do
                        on the weightier matters of the law, the choices that will move us
                        toward eternal life.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>In today's
                        world we are not true to our teachings if we are merely pro-choice. We
                        must stand up for the <em>right</em> choice. Those who persist in
                        refusing to think
                        beyond slogans and sound bites like pro-choice wander from the goals
                        they pretend to espouse and wind up giving their support to results
                        they might not
                        support if those results were presented without disguise.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>For
                        example, consider the uses some have made of the possible exceptions to
                        our firm teachings against abortion. Our leaders have taught that the
                        only possible
                        exceptions are when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, or when
                        a competent physician has determined that the life or health of the
                        mother is in serious
                        jeopardy or that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the
                        baby to survive beyond birth. But even these exceptions do not justify
                        abortion automatically.
                        Because abortion is a most serious matter, we are counseled that it
                        should be considered only after the persons responsible have consulted
                        with their bishops
                        and received divine confirmation through prayer.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Some
                        Latter-day Saints say they deplore abortion, but they give these
                        exceptional circumstances as a basis for their pro-choice position that
                        the law should
                        allow abortion on demand in all circumstances. Such persons should face
                        the reality that the circumstances described in these three exceptions
                        are extremely
                        rare. For example, conception by incest or rape--the circumstance most
                        commonly cited by those who use exceptions to argue for abortion on
                        demand--is
                        involved in only a tiny minority of abortions. More than 95 percent of
                        the millions of abortions performed each year extinguish the life of a
                        fetus conceived by
                        consensual relations. Thus the effect in over 95 percent of abortions
                        is not to vindicate choice but to avoid its consequences. Using
                        arguments of "choice" to try
                        to justify altering the consequences of choice is a classic case of
                        omitting what the Savior called "the weightier matters
                        of the law."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>A prominent
                        basis for the secular or philosophical arguments for abortion on demand
                        is the argument that a woman should have control over her own body. Not
                        long ago I received a letter from a thoughtful Latter-day Saint outside
                        the United States who analyzed that argument in secular terms. Since
                        his analysis reaches
                        the same conclusion I have urged on religious grounds, I quote it here
                        for the benefit of those most subject to persuasion on this basis:</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"Every
                        woman has, within the limits of nature, the right to choose what will
                        or will not happen to her body. Every woman has, at the same time, the
                        responsibility for the way she uses her body. If by her choice she
                        behaves in such a way that a human fetus is conceived, she has not only
                        the right <em>to</em> but also
                        the responsibility <em>for</em> that fetus. If it is an unwanted
                        pregnancy, she is not justified in ending it with the claim that it
                        interferes with her right to choose. She
                        herself chose what would happen to her body by risking pregnancy. She
                        had her choice. If she has no better reason, her conscience should tell
                        her that abortion
                        would be a highly irresponsible choice.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"What
                        constitutes a good reason? Since a human fetus has intrinsic and
                        infinite human value, the only good reason for an abortion would be the
                        violation or
                        deprivation of or the threat to the woman's right to choose what will
                        or will not happen to her body. Social, educational, financial, and
                        personal considerations
                        alone do not outweigh the value of the life that is in the fetus. These
                        considerations by themselves may properly lead to the decision to place
                        the baby for
                        adoption after its birth, but not to end its existence in utero.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>"The
                        woman's right to choose what will or will not happen to her body is
                        obviously violated by rape or incest. When conception results in such a
                        case, the
                        woman has the moral as well as the legal right to an abortion because
                        the condition of pregnancy is the result of someone else's
                        irresponsibility, not hers. She
                        does not have to take responsibility for it. To force her by law to
                        carry the fetus to term would be a further violation of her right. She
                        also has the right to refuse
                        an abortion. This would give her the right to the fetus and also the
                        responsibility for it. She could later relinquish this right and this
                        responsibility through the
                        process of placing the baby for adoption after it is born. Whichever
                        way is a responsible choice."</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>The man who
                        wrote those words also applied the same reasoning to the other
                        exceptions allowed by our doctrine--life of the mother and a baby that
                        will not
                        survive birth.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I conclude
                        this discussion of choice with two more short points.</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>If we say
                        we are anti-abortion in our personal life but pro-choice in public
                        policy, we are saying that we will not use our influence to establish
                        public policies
                        that encourage righteous choices on matters God's servants have defined
                        as serious sins. I urge Latter-day Saints who have taken that position
                        to ask themselves
                        which other grievous sins should be decriminalized or smiled on by the
                        law due to this theory that persons should not be hampered in their
                        choices. Should we
                        decriminalize or lighten the legal consequences of child abuse? of
                        cruelty to animals? of pollution? of fraud? of fathers who choose to
                        abandon their families
                        for greater freedom or convenience?</big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Similarly,
                        some reach the pro-choice position by saying we should not legislate
                        morality. Those who take this position should realize that the law of
                        crimes
                        legislates nothing but morality. Should we repeal all laws with a moral
                        basis so that our government will not punish any choices some persons
                        consider
                        immoral? Such an action would wipe out virtually all of the laws
                        against crimes. ("Weightier Matters," <em>Ensign</em>, Jan. 2001, pp.

                        course their number shall be known. Time has a way of taking care of
                        all
                        things, of elevating the good and bringing down the bad. If we see
                        things going on within the kingdom that disturb us, we might first
                        resolve, if
                        the matter falls within our stewardship, to go to the person or people
                        involved. If it is of such a nature that we think it should be called
                        to the
                        attention of higher authority, then we can, in a kindly and quiet
                        manner, take the necessary steps at the proper level. (<em>Teachings of

                        "all things"
                        means all things. He will not usurp or override our moral agency, but
                        when given an invitation, his Spirit will augment and accelerate our

                        When the Spirit, the gift of the Holy Ghost, is given a chance to

                        Mormon prophets make it very clear that the Holy Ghost is willing to
                        exert a very powerful influence in our lives when we are
                        responsive to his promptings. Nephi, Mormon, and Ether explained that
                        the Spirit strives with us to guide our lives on righteous paths (see 2
                        Ne.
                        26:11; Morm. 5:16; Ether 2:15). Moroni proclaimed that the Spirit
                        persuades us to do good (see Ether 4:11-12). Amulek taught that the
                        Holy
                        Ghost contends with us to do that which is right (see Alma 34:38), and
                        King Benjamin explained that the Holy Ghost entices us to be righteous
                        (see Mosiah 3:19).</font></big></big></p>

                        behavior
                        and clarify a certain course of action in our hearts and minds.</font></big></big></p>

                            Savior's Example</strong>. Jesus Christ set the perfect example for us.
                        Without boasting, he acknowledged that "the Father hath not left me
                        alone;
                        for I do always those things that please him" (John 8:29). He has
                        extended to each of us the invitation to "learn of me, and listen to my
                        words;
                        walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me"
                        (D&amp;C 19:23).</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Scripture</strong>.
                        Another indispensable resource that assists us in using our agency
                        wisely is holy scripture. The Apostle Paul explained, "All scripture
                        is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
                        reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (2 Tim.
                        3:16). Nephi gave
                        the additional prophetic promise that when we "feast upon the words of
                        Christ, &#8230; the words of Christ will tell [us] all things what [we]
                        should do"
                        (2 Ne. 32:3). In short, the scriptures are our life script, our
                        instruction manual in mortality, if you will. But of course, if the
                        universal teachings in
                        holy writ are to benefit us, we must follow Nephi's additional counsel
                        to "liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and
                        learning" (1
                        Ne. 19:23).</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Testimony</strong>.
                        We learn in the book of Revelation that during the war in heaven, those
                        who overcame Satan and his followers did so "by the blood
                        of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony" (see Rev. 12:7-11). A
                        testimony was an invaluable weapon in the war in heaven, and it is an
                        indispensable weapon here on earth.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">A testimony
                        that is continually being nourished and is continually growing will
                        help us at every crossroad when important decisions are made.
                        Indeed, a testimony supplants the need to make certain decisions under
                        fire, because we already know well in advance the course of action we
                        will take.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Power
                            of Prayer</strong>. The Apostle James eloquently observed that "the
                        effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much" (James
                        5:16).
                        Alma the Elder would certainly be an ardent advocate of this statement
                        by James, for when the angel appeared to Alma's wayward son, he
                        explained to Alma the Younger that "the Lord hath heard the prayers of
                        his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy
                        father;
                        for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee" (Mosiah 27:14).</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">All prayers
                        are, indeed, answered, and it is well to remember that sometimes the
                        answer is not in the affirmative. As the Son of God prayed in
                        the Garden of Gethsemane that the bitter cup might pass, an affirmative
                        reply would have thwarted the entire plan of salvation. But the Only
                        Begotten Son demonstrated his meekness and humility and obedience as he
                        added: "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke
                        22:42). The divine answer was no, but "there appeared an angel unto him
                        from heaven, strengthening him" (Luke 22:43). This is certainly a
                        prototype and a promise for each of us as we too are required to drink
                        from bitter cups in our lives. We will not be left comfortless.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Fasting</strong>.
                        There are great blessings promised to those who fast. Through the
                        prophet Isaiah, the Lord posed an important question, followed by
                        profound promises: "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose
                        the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the
                        oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?" (Isa. 58:6.)</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">When we
                        subordinate our physical needs and desires to the dictates of the
                        Spirit, we tap into a spiritual strength beyond our own. If we are in
                        bondage to bad habits or unkind thoughts, we can break the bands of
                        weakness or wickedness through fasting. Our hearts will be filled with
                        love
                        and forgiveness, and we can get on with our lives after having broken
                        "every yoke."</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Ordinances</strong>.
                        Ordinances are outward manifestations of inner covenants, commitments,
                        and promises. Ordinances are not optional on the
                        pathway to perfection. These include baptism and confirmation (see John
                        3:5; 2 Ne. 31:5-12); ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood, for all
                        males (see D&amp;C 84:33-42); the temple endowment and the sealing
                        ordinance (see D&amp;C 132:15-24).</font></big></big></p>

                        in ordinances helps us use our agency wisely and well, and a constant

                        required to decide and re-decide what we are going to do each time we
                        face temptation. Each week, through the ordinance of the sacrament,
                        we solemnly covenant to "always remember him" (Moro. 4:3; Moro. 5:2;
                        emphasis added).</font></big></big></p>

                        speaking of his servants, the Savior said: "And whatsoever they shall

                        of their decisions are now on automatic pilot, with seemingly little
                        hope of
                        changing the direction of their lives. There is little advantage to
                        living in a free country if we are in bondage to personal habits.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Debt</strong>.
                        The accumulation of financial debt is another dangerous incursion upon
                        our moral agency. A poignant description of the enslaving power
                        of debt was provided by the late President J. Reuben Clark: "Interest
                        never sleeps nor sickens nor dies; it never goes to the hospital; it
                        works on
                        Sundays and holidays; it never takes a vacation &#8230; it has no love, no
                        sympathy; it is as hard and soulless as a granite cliff. Once in debt,
                        interest
                        is your companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it
                        or slip away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to
                        entreaties,
                        demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course
                        or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you" (in Conference Report, 6
                        April 1938, p. 103).</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">There are,
                        of course, justifiable occasions when one incurs debt, such as for the
                        purchase of a house or a major business investment. But even
                        then, great wisdom should be used.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Discouragement</strong>.
                        Discouragement and its fellow travelers of depression, despair, and
                        hopelessness are much like the proverbial rocking chair:
                        they keep us busily occupied, but they do not take us anywhere.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">I have found
                        through personal experience that whenever I am discouraged and start
                        thinking only of myself and how hard hit I have been, when
                        I kneel down and count my blessings, all of a sudden my personal
                        problems do not seem large at all.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">President
                        Spencer W. Kimball provided us with excellent counsel in overcoming
                        discouragement and finding meaning to our lives: "When we
                        concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned
                        with ourselves. In the midst of the miracle of serving, there is the
                        promise of Jesus, that by losing ourselves, we find ourselves (see
                        Matt. 10:39). &#8230; The more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways,
                        the
                        more substance there is to our souls. &#8230; Indeed, it is easier to 'find'
                        ourselves because there is so much more of us to find!" (<em>Ensign</em>,
                        Dec. 1974,
                        p. 2.)</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial"><strong>Cultural
                            Traditions</strong>. A recurrent theme throughout the Book of Mormon is
                        the constraining influence of the false "tradition of their fathers"
                        passed down from Laman and Lemuel through subsequent generations (see
                        Mosiah 10:11-12; Alma 37:9; Alma 60:32; Hel. 5:51; Hel. 15:4;
                        Hel. 16:18-20). Tradition can be a double-edged sword. When based upon
                        the perpetuation of righteous principles, tradition can become a
                        marvelous support system in helping us employ our moral agency wisely.
                        On the other hand, many traditions find their origins in the false
                        pride
                        and foibles of mankind. In modern-day revelation, the Lord has taught:
                        "Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning. &#8230; [But] that wicked
                        one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from
                        the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers"
                        (D&amp;C
                        93:38-39; emphasis added).</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Cultural
                        customs and traditions often provide a useful map for the members of a
                        given society, but if we are to become members of a celestial
                        culture, we must overcome the natural man reflected in earthly cultures
                        (see Mosiah 3:19; D&amp;C 88:22). Indeed, some cultural
                        enticements--such
                        as following the crowd in matters of fashion and acceptance of worldly
                        standards--are spiritually, and sometimes even physically, destructive.
                        John the Revelator admonished us to "love not the world, neither the
                        things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of
                        the
                        Father is not in him" (1 Jn. 2:15; emphasis added; see James 4:4).
