                                        style="font-family: arial;">But I want to speak a word or two in
                                        relation to another
                                        death, which is a more terrible death than that of the body. When Adam,
                                        our first parent, partook of the forbidden fruit, transgressed the law
                                        of God, and became subject unto Satan, he was banished from the
                                        presence
                                        of God, and was thrust out into outer spiritual darkness. This was the
                                        first death. Yet living, he was dead--dead to God, dead to light and
                                        truth,
                                        dead spiritually; cast out from the presence of God; communication
                                        between
                                        the Father and the Son was cut off. He was as absolutely thrust out
                                        from
                                        the presence of God as was Satan and the hosts that followed him. That
                                        was spiritual death. But the Lord said that he would not suffer Adam
                                        nor
                                        his posterity to come to the temporal death until they should have the
                                        means by which they might be redeemed from the first death, which is
                                        spiritual.
                                        Therefore angels were sent unto Adam, who taught him the gospel, and
                                        revealed
                                        to him the principle by which he could be redeemed from the first
                                        death,
                                        and be brought back from banishment and outer darkness into the
                                        marvelous
                                        light of the gospel. He was taught faith, repentance, and baptism for
                                        the
                                        remission of sins, in the name of Jesus Christ, who should come in the
                                        meridian of time and take away the sin of the world, and was thus given
                                        a chance to be redeemed from the spiritual death before he should die
                                        the
                                        temporal death.</span></big></big></font></big></big><br

                                    all the world today, I am sorry to say, with the exception
                                    of a handful of people who have obeyed the new and everlasting
                                    covenant,
                                    are suffering this spiritual death. They are cast out from the presence
                                    of God. They are without God, without gospel truth, and without the
                                    power
                                    of redemption; for they know not God nor his gospel. In order that they
                                    may be redeemed and saved from the spiritual death which has spread
                                    over
                                    the world like a pall, they must repent of their sins, and be baptized
                                    by one having authority, for the remission of their sins, that they may
                                    be born of God. That is why we want these young men to go out into the
                                    world to preach the gospel. While they themselves understand but
                                    little,
                                    perhaps, the germ of life is in them. They have been born again, they
                                    have
                                    received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and they have the authority of the
                                    holy Priesthood, by which they can administer in the name of the
                                    Father,
                                    and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Though they may know but little
                                    in the beginning, they can learn, and as they learn they can preach,
                                    and
                                    as they have opportunity they can baptize for the remission of sins.
                                    Therefore,
                                    we want them to do their duty at home. We want them above all things to
                                    be pure in heart. (<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, pp.432-433)</big></big></font></big></big>&nbsp;

                                        are called mortal beings because in us are seeds of death,
                                        but in reality we are immortal beings, because there is also within us
                                        the germ of eternal life. Man is a dual being, composed of the spirit
                                        which
                                        gives life, force, intelligence and capacity to man, and the body which
                                        is the tenement of the spirit and is suited to its form, adapted to its
                                        necessities, and acts in harmony with it, and to its utmost capacity
                                        yields
                                        obedience to the will of the spirit. The two combined constitute the
                                        soul.
                                        The body is dependent upon the spirit, and the spirit during its
                                        natural
                                        occupancy of the body is subject to the laws which apply to and govern
                                        it in the mortal state. In this natural body are the seeds of weakness
                                        and decay, which, when fully ripened or untimely plucked up, in the
                                        language
                                        of scripture, is called "the temporal death." The spirit is also
                                        subject
                                        to what is termed in the scriptures and revelations from God,
                                        "spiritual
                                        death." The same as that which befell our first parents, when, through
                                        disobedience and transgression, they became subject to the will of
                                        Satan,
                                        and were thrust out from the presence of the Lord and became
                                        spiritually
                                        dead, which the Lord says, "is the first death, even that same death
                                        which
                                        is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon
                                        the
                                        wicked when I shall say, Depart, ye cursed!" And the Lord further says,
                                        "But behold, I say unto you, that I the Lord God gave unto Adam and
                                        unto
                                        his seed that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I the
                                        Lord God should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and
                                        redemption
                                        (from the first death), through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten
                                        Son. And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his
                                        probation;
                                        that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto
                                        eternal
                                        life, even as many as would believe; and they that believe not, unto
                                        eternal
                                        damnation, for they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall,
                                        because
                                        they repent not." From the natural death, that is the death of the
                                        body,
                                        and also from the first death, "which is spiritual," there is
                                        redemption
                                        through belief on the name of the Only Begotten Son, in connection with
                                        repentance and obedience to the ordinances of the gospel, declared by
                                        holy
                                        angels, for if one "believe," he must also obey; but from the "second
                                        death,"
                                        even that same death which is the first death, "which is spiritual,"
                                        and
                                        from which man may be redeemed through faith and obedience, and which
                                        will
                                        again be pronounced upon the wicked when God shall say, "depart, ye
                                        cursed,"
                                        there is no redemption, so far as light on this matter has been
                                        revealed.

                                    and power of the everlasting God; or, on the other hand, forever remain
                                    bound in the chains of spiritual darkness, bondage and banishment from
                                    his presence, kingdom and glory. The "temporal death" is one thing, and
                                    the "spiritual death" is another thing. The body may be dissolved and
                                    become
                                    extinct as an organism, although the elements of which it is composed
                                    are
                                    indestructible or eternal, but I hold it as self-evident that the
                                    spiritual
                                    organism is an eternal, immortal being, destined to enjoy eternal
                                    happiness
                                    and a fulness of joy, or suffer the wrath of God, and misery--a just
                                    condemnation,
                                    eternally. Adam became spiritually dead, yet he lived to endure it
                                    until
                                    freed therefrom by the power of the atonement, through repentance, etc.
                                    Those upon whom the second death shall fall will live to suffer and
                                    endure
                                    it, but without hope of redemption. The death of the body, or natural
                                    death,
                                    is but a temporary circumstance to which all were subjected through the
                                    fall, and from which all will be restored or resurrected by the power
                                    of
                                    God, through the atonement of Christ. (<i>Gospel Doctrine</i>, pp.14-16)</big></big></font></big></big></div>

                                absolve, propitiate, make amends, pay the penalty. Thus the atonement
                                of
                                Christ is designed to ransom men from the effects of the fall of Adam
                                in
                                that both spiritual and temporal death are conquered; their lasting

                                is nullified. The spiritual death of the fall is replaced by the
                                spiritual
                                life of the atonement, in that all who believe and obey the gospel law
                                gain spiritual or eternal life -- life in the presence of God where
                                those
                                who enjoy it are alive to things of righteousness or things of the
