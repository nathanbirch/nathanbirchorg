                            and

                            celestial law, we cannot inherit a celestial kingdom. What is it to
                            obey
                            a celestial law? Where does the celestial law come from to begin with?
                            From the heavens. Very well. What have the people here to do with it
                            generally
                            -- that is, outsiders? Nothing. They do not say they have had any
                            revelation.
                            They have had no principle of that kind unfolded to them. They are
                            living
                            under what might be termed a terrestrial law; and many of them, I
                            think,
                            under the circumstances, do quite as well as we do under our
                            circumstances.
                            We profess to be moving on a more elevated plane than they are. We
                            profess
                            to have come out from the world; to have separated from the ungodly. We
                            profess to be under the guidance of apostles and prophets, pastors and
                            teachers, etc., and to be living under the inspiration of the Most
                            High.
                            They do not profess anything of the kind. (<i>The Gospel Kingdom</i>,

                            in the world of spirits some of the intelligences were greater than

                            yet these also were entitled to salvation from death and the torment of
                            the damned. The Lord therefore had a place for these, thus showing his
                            great mercy for all.</big></font></big></li>

                            of
                            the
                            Lord to Moses that the Lord selected a place for the children of
                            Israel,
                            even before they were born, thus he indicated the number of spirits who
                            were assigned to become the descendants of Jacob (Deut. 32:8-9). We may
                            well believe that the Lord also parceled out the surface of the earth
                            for
                            all other peoples. Some of these places were evidently designed for
                            inhabitants
                            who had lost interest in or touch with the plan of salvation. We may
                            well
                            believe that the Lord did not permit the more progressive and more
                            worthy
                            spirits to come to the families of the ungodly and the less progressive

                            less progressive class, however, to come to the earth, and it was
                            essential
                            for them to receive the blessings of morality. On this topic, however,
                            there is very little revealed, but we may feel certain that it was
                            essential
                            that the more progressive and intelligent spirits were not sent to the
                            tribes among the degraded heathen. These people naturally sank under
                            such
                            circumstances into a condition of ignorance and spiritual darkness.
                            Children
                            born under such circumstances could not be exalted, yet the Lord in his
                            mercy had decreed to them to do the very best that could be done. Not
                            having
                            knowledge of the things of God, they were to be judged without law and
                            assigned to a place after the resurrection that would be suited to them

                            it, and neglected it, need not hope or anticipate that when they are

                            the work can be done for them and they gain celestial glory. Don't you
                            Latter-day Saints get the notion that a man or woman can live in
                            defiance
                            or total indifference, having had a good chance -- not a casual chance
                            or opportunity -- and when they die you can go and do the work for that
                            individual and have them receive every blessing that the faithful ones
                            are entitled to. If that becomes the doctrine of the Church we will be
                            worse than the Catholics who believe that you can pray a man out of
                            purgatory.
                            But they charge for it and we don't, so we would be more foolish than
                            they.

                        be
                        necessary for you to have a knowledge of the truth of this work for
                        yourselves.
                        The difficulties will be of such a character that the man or woman who
                        does not possess this personal knowledge or witness will fall. If you
                        have
                        not got the testimony, live right and call upon the Lord and cease not
                        till you obtain it. If you do not you will not stand. &#8230;</big></font>

                        and faith.' (D&amp;C 21:4-5.) There will be some things that take
                        patience

                        himself,
                        with patience and faith, the promise is that 'the gates of hell shall

                        is to be courageous and bold; to use all our
                        strength,
                        energy, and ability in the warfare with the world; to fight the good
                        fight
                        of faith. "Be strong and of a good courage," the Lord commanded Joshua,
                        and then specified that this strength and courage consisted of
                        meditating
                        upon and observing to do all that is written in the law of the Lord.
                        (See
                        Josh. 1:6-9.) The great cornerstone of valiance in the cause of
                        righteousness
                        is obedience to the whole law of the whole gospel.</big></font>

                        and "love God" with all our "might, mind and strength." (Moro. 10:32.)</big></font>

                        in Christ and his gospel with unshakable conviction. It is to know of

                        this is not all. It is more than believing and
                        knowing.
                        We must be doers of the word and not hearers only. It is more than lip
                        service; it is not simply confessing with the mouth the divine Sonship
                        of the Savior. It is obedience and conformity and personal

                        It is to live our religion, to practice what we preach, to keep the
                        commandments.
                        It is the manifestation of "pure religion" in the lives of men; it is
                        visiting
                        "the fatherless and widows in their affliction" and keeping ourselves

                            man lives for himself. Adam was made to open
                            the
                            way of the world, and for dressing the garden. Noah was born to save
                            seed
                            of everything, when the earth was washed of its wickedness by the
                            flood;
                            and the Son of God came into the world to redeem it from the fall. But
                            except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. This
                            eternal
                            truth settles the question of all men's religion. A man may be saved,
                            after
                            the judgment, in the terrestrial kingdom, or in the telestial kingdom,
                            but he can never see the celestial kingdom of God, without being born
                            of
                            water and the Spirit. He may receive a glory like unto the moon, [i.e.,
                            of which the light of the moon is typical], or a star, [i.e., of which
                            the light of the stars is typical], but he can never come unto Mount
                            Zion,
                            and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
                            innumerable company of angels; to the general assembly and church of
                            the
                            Firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all,
                            and
                            to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of
                            the
                            new covenant, unless he becomes as a little child, and is taught by the
                            Spirit of God. (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>, p.12)</big></font>&nbsp;
