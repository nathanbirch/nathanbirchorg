                        would have us waste our time in activities that impede our progress on
                        the pathway to perfection. Following are some of the many enemies of
                        agency. &nbsp;...<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Traditions</span>.
                        A recurrent theme throughout the Book of Mormon is the constraining
                        influence of the false “tradition of their fathers” passed down from
                        Laman and Lemuel through subsequent generations (see Mosiah 10:11–12;
                        Alma 37:9; Alma 60:32; Hel. 5:51; Hel. 15:4; Hel. 16:18–20). Tradition
                        can be a double-edged sword. When based upon the perpetuation of
                        righteous principles, tradition can become a marvelous support system
                        in helping us employ our moral agency wisely. On the other hand, many
                        traditions find their origins in the false pride and foibles of
                        mankind. In modern-day revelation, the Lord has taught: “Every spirit
                        of man was innocent in the beginning. … [But] that wicked one cometh
                        and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the
                        children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers”
                        (D&amp;C 93:38–39; emphasis added).<br><br>Cultural customs and
                        traditions often provide a useful map for the members of a given
                        society, but if we are to become members of a celestial culture, we
                        must overcome the natural man reflected in earthly cultures (see Mosiah
                        3:19; D&amp;C 88:22). Indeed, some cultural enticements—such as
                        following the crowd in matters of fashion and acceptance of worldly
                        standards—are spiritually, and sometimes even physically, destructive.
                        John the Revelator admonished us to “love not the world, neither the
                        things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of
                        the Father is not in him” (1 Jn. 2:15; emphasis added; see James 4:4).

                                    behavior. Customs which are perfectly acceptable in one culture are
                                    viewed as unacceptable in another; language which is polite in some
                                    places is viewed as abhorrent in others. People in every culture move
                                    within a cocoon of self-satisfied self-deception, fully convinced that
                                    the way they see things is the way things really are.</font></p>

                                    and our attitudes toward honesty</u>. <u>It also influences men as to

                    shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into
