                            basic ways or methods of obtaining living water from the scriptural
                            reservoir: (1) reading the scriptures from beginning to end, (2)
                            studying the scriptures by topic, and (3) searching the scriptures for
                            connections, patterns, and themes. Each of these approaches can help
                            satisfy our spiritual thirst if we invite the companionship and
                            assistance of the Holy Ghost as we read, study, and search.</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Reading a book of scripture from beginning to end initiates the flow of
                            living water into our lives by introducing us to important stories,
                            gospel doctrines, and timeless principles. This approach also enables
                            us to learn about major characters in the scriptures and the sequence,
                            timing, and context of events and teachings. Reading the written word
                            in this way exposes us to the breadth of a volume of scripture. This is
                            the first and most fundamental way of obtaining living water.</span><br

                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Studying by topic typically follows, grows out of, and builds upon our
                            reading of the scriptures from beginning to end. For example, as we
                            read the Book of Mormon we may identify and seek to find answers to
                            important doctrinal and practical questions such as these:</span><br

                        <br style="font-family: arial;">
                    </big></big>
                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><span
                                style="font-family: arial;">&#8226; What is faith in the Savior? </span></big></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">&#8226; Why is faith in Jesus
                                Christ the first principle of the gospel? </span></big></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">&#8226; Why and how does faith in
                                the Redeemer lead to repentance? </span></big></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">&#8226; How does the Atonement
                                strengthen me to do things in my daily life that I could never do with
                                my own limited capacity and in my own strength? </span></big></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                </div>
                <big><big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">Focusing upon such questions and
                            studying by topic, using the Topical Guide and index to the triple
                            combination, allow us to dig into and explore the depth of the
                            scriptures and obtain a much richer spiritual knowledge. This approach
                            increases the rate at which living water flows into our lives.</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;<br>
                            Both reading from beginning to end and studying by topic are
                            prerequisites to the third basic method of obtaining living water from
                            the scriptural reservoir. Whereas reading a book of scripture from
                            beginning to end provides a basic breadth of knowledge, studying by
                            topic increases the depth of our knowledge. Searching in the
                            revelations for connections, patterns, and themes builds upon and adds
                            to our spiritual knowledge by bringing together and expanding these
                            first two methods; it broadens our perspective and understanding of the
                            plan of salvation.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            In my judgment, diligently searching to discover connections, patterns,
                            and themes is in part what it means to &#8220;feast&#8221; upon the words of
                            Christ. This approach can open the floodgates of the spiritual
                            reservoir, enlighten our understanding through His Spirit, and produce
                            a depth of gratitude for the holy scriptures and a degree of spiritual
                            commitment that can be received in no other way. Such searching enables
                            us to build upon the rock of our Redeemer and to withstand the winds of
                            wickedness in these latter days.&nbsp; <small><br>
