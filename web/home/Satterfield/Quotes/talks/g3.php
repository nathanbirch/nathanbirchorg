                                        a Sunday evening in a west coast airport, I met a friend from college
                                        days.
                                        As we talked of olden times, the names and faces of classmates were
                                        drawn
                                        from memory like clips from old movies. Some few are gone, but most
                                        have
                                        retired and spend their time with families, traveling, many of them
                                        serving
                                        missions. In their older days they draw on resources, seen and unseen,
                                        which they earned when they were young.</big></big></big></font>

                                        by wealth or prominence, having made a success of those things which
                                        matter
                                        most-faith and family. I asked about one classmate, more gifted than
                                        all
                                        the rest of us, the one most likely to succeed. We had all watched as
                                        he
                                        rose to national prominence and then disappeared. Where was he now?</big></big></big></font>

                                        of a poet, John Greenleaf Whittier. He told of a peasant girl, Maud
                                        Muller.
                                        One day as she worked in the hayfield with her family, she stopped to
                                        drink
                                        from the spring. As she stooped to get a drink, a rider on horseback
                                        drew
                                        near. Maud Muller looked up into the face of a noble young man. He
                                        asked
                                        her for a drink.</big></big></big></font>

                                        covenants,

                                        principles.
                                        The first principle is this: We are dual beings, a spirit son or
                                        daughter
                                        of God, alive and intelligent in the first estate, confined now to a
                                        body
                                        of flesh and bone. "The spirit and the body are the soul of man"
                                        (D&amp;C
                                        88:15). The spirit is eternal; the body will become so. There are
                                        languages
                                        we can speak and hear with the body. There are languages of the spirit,
                                        one being revelation.</big></big></big></font>

                                        second principle: There are two sources of revelation-the one
                                        consistent
                                        with the great plan of happiness, the other growing from "the cunning
                                        plan
                                        of the evil one" (2 Nephi 9:28). So that we will not be deceived, there
                                        is order in the Church and there are established channels through which
                                        revelation is given to the Church and to us, its members, as

                                        what of my college classmate who fell away into forbidden paths and was
                                        lost? Will he be gone forever? Not so! The final page will not be
                                        turned,
                                        nor the record of the plan of salvation put away, until he too is
                                        redeemed.
                                        He will pay the uttermost farthing (Matthew 5:26) for his mistakes, for
                                        the law requires it. But Mercy, our gentle friend, will revisit him and
                                        remind him of his accountability until finally he is willing to yield
                                        to
                                        the demands of Justice, clean up his premises, haul away the rubbish
                                        left
                                        there by both sin and transgression, and put his house in order.</big></big></big></font>
