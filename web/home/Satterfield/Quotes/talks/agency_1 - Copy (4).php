                            years past we generally used the term free agency. That is not
                            incorrect. More recently we have taken note that free agency does not
                            appear in the scriptures. They talk of our being &#8220;free to choose&#8221; and
                            &#8220;free to act&#8221; for ourselves (2 Nephi 2:27; 10:23; see also Helaman
                            14:30) and of our obligation to do many things of our own &#8220;free will&#8221;
                            (D&amp;C 58:27). But the word agency appears either by itself or with
                            the modifier moral: &#8220;That every man may act in doctrine and principle &#8230;
                            according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every
                            man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment&#8221;
                            (D&amp;C 101:78; emphasis added). When we use the term moral agency, we
                            are appropriately emphasizing the accountability that is an essential
                            part of the divine gift of agency. We are moral beings and agents unto
                            ourselves, free to choose but also responsible for our choices. <small>(&#8220;Moral

                                don't believe that the Priesthood has been bestowed upon men merely for
                                their own aggrandizement. I look upon this power as an agency for
                                service to mankind. I have characterized it as the perfect plan of
                                service. I believe that it will not greatly profit any man to hold the
                                power of the Priesthood unless he uses that power for the benefit of
                                his fellows. Indeed, I have come to think that the holding of the power
                                may conduce to his condemnation rather than his exaltation, if he is
                                indifferent to it and fails to utilize it for the advancement of God's

                                Himself, and has given him his individual agency. Man is made in the
                                likeness of his Creator, the great archetype of the human species, who
                                bestowed upon him the principles of eternity, planting immortality
                                within him, and leaving him at liberty to act in the way that seemeth
                                good unto him, to choose or refuse for himself ....&nbsp; As I have
                                just stated, the Lord Almighty has organized every human creature for
                                the express purpose of becoming independent, and has designed that they
                                should be capable of receiving the principles of eternity to a fulness;
                                and when they have received them unto a fulness, they are made perfect,
                                like unto the Son of Man, and become Gods, even the Sons of God. <small>(<span
