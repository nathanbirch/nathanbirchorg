                            would have us waste our time in activities that impede our progress on
                            the pathway to perfection. Following are some of the many enemies of
                            agency.</big></span><br>

                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Addiction</span>. Many people lead
                            empty lives completely devoid of purpose, meaning, and direction. Empty
                            lives must be filled with something, anything, so some people fill
                            their empty lives with endless hours of television, while others become
                            addicted to pornography, alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Still
                            others develop an unhealthy capacity for overeating. And ever so surely
                            these individuals trade their moral agency for their addiction until
                            they are no longer able to exercise their agency. All of their
                            decisions are now on automatic pilot, with seemingly little hope of
                            changing the direction of their lives. There is little advantage to
                            living in a free country if we are in bondage to personal habits.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Debt.</span> The accumulation of
                            financial debt is another dangerous incursion upon our moral agency. A
                            poignant description of the enslaving power of debt was provided by the
                            late President J. Reuben Clark: &#8220;Interest never sleeps nor sickens nor
                            dies; it never goes to the hospital; it works on Sundays and holidays;
                            it never takes a vacation &#8230; it has no love, no sympathy; it is as hard
                            and soulless as a granite cliff. Once in debt, interest is your
                            companion every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip
                            away from it; you cannot dismiss it; it yields neither to entreaties,
                            demands, or orders; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course
                            or fail to meet its demands, it crushes you&#8221; (in Conference Report, 6
                            April 1938, p. 103).</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            There are, of course, justifiable occasions when one incurs debt, such
                            as for the purchase of a house or a major business investment. But even
                            then, great wisdom should be used.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discouragement</span>. Discouragement
                            and its fellow travelers of depression, despair, and hopelessness are
                            much like the proverbial rocking chair: they keep us busily occupied,
                            but they do not take us anywhere.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            I have found through personal experience that whenever I am discouraged
                            and start thinking only of myself and how hard hit I have been, when I
                            kneel down and count my blessings, all of a sudden my personal problems
                            do not seem large at all.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            President Spencer W. Kimball provided us with excellent counsel in
                            overcoming discouragement and finding meaning to our lives: &#8220;When we
                            concern ourselves more with others, there is less time to be concerned
                            with ourselves. In the midst of the miracle of serving, there is the
                            promise of Jesus, that by losing ourselves, we find ourselves (see
                            Matt. 10:39). &#8230; The more we serve our fellowmen in appropriate ways,
                            the more substance there is to our souls. &#8230; Indeed, it is easier to
                            &#8216;find&#8217; ourselves because there is so much more of us to find!&#8221; (Ensign,
                            Dec. 1974, p. 2.)</big></span><br>

                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultural Traditions</span>. A
                            recurrent theme throughout the Book of Mormon is the constraining
                            influence of the false &#8220;tradition of their fathers&#8221; passed down from
                            Laman and Lemuel through subsequent generations (see Mosiah 10:11&#8211;12;
                            Alma 37:9; Alma 60:32; Hel. 5:51; Hel. 15:4; Hel. 16:18&#8211;20). Tradition
                            can be a double-edged sword. When based upon the perpetuation of
                            righteous principles, tradition can become a marvelous support system
                            in helping us employ our moral agency wisely. On the other hand, many
                            traditions find their origins in the false pride and foibles of
                            mankind. In modern-day revelation, the Lord has taught: &#8220;Every spirit
                            of man was innocent in the beginning. &#8230; [But] that wicked one cometh
                            and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the
                            children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers&#8221;
                            (D&amp;C 93:38&#8211;39; emphasis added).</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Cultural customs and traditions often provide a useful map for the
                            members of a given society, but if we are to become members of a
                            celestial culture, we must overcome the natural man reflected in
                            earthly cultures (see Mosiah 3:19; D&amp;C 88:22). Indeed, some
                            cultural enticements&#8212;such as following the crowd in matters of fashion
                            and acceptance of worldly standards&#8212;are spiritually, and sometimes even
                            physically, destructive. John the Revelator admonished us to &#8220;love not
                            the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love
                            the world, the love of the Father is not in him&#8221; (1 Jn. 2:15; emphasis
                            added; see James 4:4).&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(&#8220;Agency: The Gift of

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><big>When
                            we believe or say we have been offended, we usually mean we feel
                            insulted, mistreated, snubbed, or disrespected. And certainly clumsy,
                            embarrassing, unprincipled, and mean-spirited things do occur in our
                            interactions with other people that would allow us to take offense.
                            However, it ultimately is impossible for another person to offend you
                            or to offend me. Indeed, believing that another person offended us is
                            fundamentally false. To be offended is a choice we make; it is not a
                            condition inflicted or imposed upon us by someone or something else.</big></span><br>

                            In the grand division of all of God&#8217;s creations, there are things to
                            act and things to be acted upon (see 2 Nephi 2:13&#8211;14). As sons and
                            daughters of our Heavenly Father, we have been blessed with the gift of
                            moral agency, the capacity for independent action and choice. Endowed
                            with agency, you and I are agents, and we primarily are to act and not
                            just be acted upon. To believe that someone or something can make us
                            feel offended, angry, hurt, or bitter diminishes our moral agency and
                            transforms us into objects to be acted upon. As agents, however, you
                            and I have the power to act and to choose how we will respond to an
                            offensive or hurtful situation. ...</big></span><br>

                            You and I cannot control the intentions or behavior of other people.
                            However, we do determine how we will act. Please remember that you and
                            I are agents endowed with moral agency, and we can choose not to be
                            offended. <small>(&#8220;And Nothing Shall Offend Them,&#8221; <span
