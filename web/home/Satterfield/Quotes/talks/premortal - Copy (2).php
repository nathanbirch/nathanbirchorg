                                    the Lord has fragmentarily revealed. We know, however, that there is

                                    not fully understand, was co-eternal with him and always existed, there
                                    is no argument that we can or should present to contradict it. Why he
                                    cannot create intelligence is simply because intelligence, like time
                                    and space, always existed, and therefore did not have to be created.
