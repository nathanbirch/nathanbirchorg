                <p><font size=-1>I have titled these remarks "The Perfect Law of Liberty."</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>As a youth, I was stirred by Patrick Henry's famous battle
                    cry, "Give me liberty or give me death!"</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>The meaning of the word liberty is difficult to circumscribe.
                    Abraham Lincoln was of the opinion that "the world has never had a good
                    definition of [the term]. We all declare for liberty," he said; "but in
                    using the same word we do not mean the same thing. With some, the word
                    liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself and the
                    product of his labor; while with others [liberty] may mean for some men
                    to do as they please with other men and the product of other men's labor."</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Again he said, "The shepherd drives the wolf from the
                    sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator,
                    while the wolf denounces him for the same act." (Address, 18 Apr. 1864;
                    quoted in John Bartlett, <i>Familiar Quotations</i>, 15th ed., Boston:
                    Little, Brown and Co., 1980, p. 523.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>The issues have changed since the time of Lincoln, but
                    the multipurpose use of the word liberty and its synonym freedom has not
                    changed. The sweets of liberty about which we usually speak may be classified
                    as (1) political independence, (2) economic freedom, and (3) free agency.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>I would have us strive for that liberty which comprehends
                    all three of these freedoms, and more. I would have us strive for a freedom
                    of the soul to which they all contribute. I would have us attain that blessed
                    state foreshadowed by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he said, "Let virtue
                    garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong
                    in the presence of God." (D&amp;C 121:45.) One who enjoys such liberty
                    is, in the words of Jesus, "free indeed." (John 8:36.) He is possessed
                    of perfect liberty.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>I invite your attention to a few illustrations in support
                    of the thesis that, while political independence, economic freedom, and
                    free agency may contribute to liberty of the soul, they do not guarantee
                    it.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>First, as to political independence and power:</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>In this field, perhaps the exploits of Alexander the Great
                    are among the most widely known. With high physical courage, impulsive
                    energy, and fervid imagination, he, at the unripe age of thirty-two years,
                    became to all intents and purposes master of the then-known world. But
                    he was far from enjoying liberty, for of himself he was not master. In
                    his thirty-third year he died, a victim of his own excesses, a total stranger
                    to freedom of the soul.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Cardinal Wolsey learned, to his sorrow, how little political
                    independence and even political power can contribute to true liberty. You
                    may recall that he gave a long life in the service of two English sovereigns,
                    enjoying all the while great freedom and political power. Finally, however,
                    he was shorn of all his greatness by an impatient king. As he stood, disillusioned,
                    among the ruins of his life, he lamented to his friend,</font>

                    <br><font size=-1></font>&nbsp;<font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Several years ago an article appeared in a magazine concerning
                    some of the financial wizards of this century. It recorded how some of
                    these men had died broke and in disgrace; others had committed suicide,
                    and some had spent time in prison. All of the men had obtained, temporarily
                    at least, economic freedom, but to none of them did their economic abundance
                    bring freedom of the soul.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>While perhaps it is seldom, if ever, contended that either
                    political independence or economic freedom alone brings perfect liberty,
                    it is not, however, uncommon for free agency to be considered as synonymous
                    with freedom of the soul. And it is true that the God-given right to choose
                    one's course of action is an indispensable prerequisite to such freedom.
                    Without it we can scarcely enjoy any type of liberty--political, economic,
                    or personal. It is one of our greatest heritages. For it we are deeply
                    indebted to our Father in Heaven, to the Founding Fathers, and to the pioneers.
                    God gave it to man in the Garden of Eden. (See Moses 7:32.) The Founding
                    Fathers, under the Lord's inspiration, wrote a guarantee of it into the
                    fundamental law of the land. And the pioneers, led by the inspiration of
                    heaven, gave their all to perpetuate it. Surely we ought always to be alert
                    in its defense and willing, if necessary, to give our lives for its preservation.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Free agency, however, precious as it is, is not of itself
                    the perfect liberty we seek, nor does it necessarily lead thereto. As a
                    matter of fact, through the exercise of their agency more people have come
                    to political, economic, and personal bondage than to liberty.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>The Nephites, for example, at one time, by the exercise
                    of their agency, brought themselves to such a state of affairs that their
                    only course led to political bondage. This they did [page 44] while living
                    under a government providing for the freest exercise of agency. "Their
                    laws and their governments," says the record, "were established by the
                    voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they
                    who chose good." Therefore, "they could not be governed by the law nor
                    justice, save it were to their destruction." (Hel. 5:2-3.) Under these
                    circumstances, they chose as rulers wicked men, who would certainly destroy
                    their political liberties, to replace righteous men who had in the past
                    protected and preserved those liberties and would have continued to do
                    so in the future.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>The freewill choosing of a king by the Jaredites led directly
                    to their captivity. (See Ether 6:21-7:5.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>This sequence was repeated in the days of Israel. The
                    people--rejecting government by judges, which God had established--clamored
                    for Samuel to give them a king. Notwithstanding Samuel's warning that a
                    king would make servants of their children, lay heavy taxes and services
                    upon their backs, and send them to war, "the people refused to obey the
                    voice of Samuel, [saying,] Nay; but we will have a king over us;</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"That we also may be like all the nations." (1 Sam. 8:19-20.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Samuel therefore anointed Saul to be their king. In due
                    time, just as Samuel had predicted, heavy burdens were laid upon them,
                    their sons and daughters were made servants of the king, and war came.
                    The nation was divided into two kingdoms, Israel and Judah, both of which
                    were, in their turn, carried away into captivity. Not only did they lose
                    their political freedom, but their very political existence as nations
                    was terminated.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>We have a classic example of the loss of economic freedom
                    by the [page 45] misuse of free agency in the book of Genesis. The Egyptians,
                    instead of exercising their agency to provide for themselves against a
                    day of need, depended upon the government. As a result, when the famine
                    came they were forced to purchase food from the government. First they
                    used their money. When that was gone, they gave their livestock, then their
                    lands; and finally they were compelled to sell themselves into slavery,
                    that they might eat. (See Gen. 41:54-56; Gen. 47:13-26.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>We ourselves have gone a long way down this road during
                    the last century. My counsel is that we beware of the doctrine which encourages
                    us to seek government-supported security rather than to put faith in our
                    own industry. Remember Pope's peasant who, having been served the rich
                    man's feast and finding the consequences, complained:</font>
                    <br><font size=-1></font>&nbsp;<font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"An't please Your Honour," quoth the peasant,</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"This same dessert is not so pleasant:</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Give me again my hollow tree,</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>A crust of bread and Liberty."</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>(Alexander Pope, "The Sixth Satire of the Second Book
                    of Horace," lines 218-21.)</font>
                    <br><font size=-1></font>&nbsp;<font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>With respect to the loss of personal liberty through the
                    misuse of free agency, our daily lives are filled with tragic evidence.
                    We see the alcoholic with his craving for drink, the dope fiend in his
                    frenzy, and worse, the pervert with his irretrievable loss of manhood.
                    Who will say that such persons enjoy liberty?</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Notwithstanding the fact that through its misuse, political,
                    economic, and personal liberty are lost,<span STYLE="text-decoration: underline">
                        free agency will always endure because it is an eternal principle. However,
                        the free agency possessed by any one person is increased or diminished
                        by the use to which he puts it. Every wrong decision one makes restricts
                        the area in which he can thereafter exercise his agency. The further one
                        goes in the making of wrong decisions in the exercise of free agency, the
                        more difficult it is for him to recover the lost ground. One can, by persisting
                        long enough, reach the point of no return. He then becomes an abject slave.
                        By the exercise of his free agency, he has decreased the area in which
                        he can act, almost to the vanishing point.</span> [Emphasis has been added
                    to this text]]</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Samuel, the Lamanite prophet, speaking to those who so
                    persisted, said: "In the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord;
                    and in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you,
                    and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that
                    day … and say: …</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"O that we had repented in the day that the word of the
                    Lord came unto us. …</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled
                    about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. … O Lord,
                    canst thou not turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your language
                    in those days.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have
                    procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too
                    late, and your destruction is made sure." (Hel. 13:32, 36-38.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>These poor souls have placed themselves in the power of
                    Lucifer and his followers, who, as you remember, became Perdition. (See
                    D&amp;C 76:26.) Their final fate is to be cast out into outer darkness,
                    such punishment being the natural consequence of the alternatives they
                    elected in the exercise of their agency. The fact that they were originally
                    endowed by their Creator with free agency does not save them from the most
                    awful bondage, the bondage of sin.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Just as following wrong alternatives restricts free agency
                    and leads to slavery, so pursuing correct alternatives widens the scope
                    of one's agency and leads to perfect liberty. As a matter of fact, one
                    may, by this process, obtain freedom of the soul while at the same time
                    being denied political, economic, and personal liberty.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>For example, consider the Prophet Joseph Smith. Here was
                    a man enjoying freedom of the soul while suffering the deprivation of almost
                    every other liberty. The experiences of his life were in some respects
                    comparable to those of the Apostle Paul, who in his labors suffered stripes
                    often, imprisonment frequently, and repeatedly faced death. Reviewing some
                    of his experiences for the Corinthians, he said:</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save
                    one.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice
                    I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils
                    of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen,
                    in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea,
                    in perils among false brethren;</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in
                    hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness." (2 Cor. 11:24-27.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Notwithstanding all this, he could write to his beloved
                    Timothy from his prison cell in Rome shortly before his death: "I am now
                    ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,

                <p><font size=-1>"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
                    which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not
                    to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing." (2 Tim. 4:6-8.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Surely Paul, in his soul, enjoyed perfect freedom.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>The Apostle's conclusion that the reward won by him is
                    to be available to others suggests that there must be a pattern of living
                    by which each of us may attain it, and I believe there is.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Many years ago, while riding through Cleveland, Ohio,
                    on a train, I saw on a building the inscription "Obedience to Law is Liberty."
                    With the proper interpretation of the word law, we have in this inscription
                    a statement of ultimate truth. By inserting three words, it is made to
                    read, "Obedience to the law of Christ is liberty." (See D&amp;C 88:21.)
                    This is not only a statement of the perfect law of liberty, but also a
                    statement of the way to perfect liberty.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>In the eighth chapter of John is recorded a controversy
                    between Jesus and the rulers of the Jews. They, of course, rejected him.
                    But some who heard believed, and to them he said, "If ye continue in my
                    word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make
                    you free." (John 8:31-32.)</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>Freedom thus obtained--that is, by obedience to the law
                    of Christ--is freedom of the soul, the highest form of liberty. And the
                    most glorious thing about it is that it is within the reach of every one
                    of us, regardless of what people about us, or even nations, do. All we
                    have to do is learn the law of Christ and obey it. To learn it and obey
                    it is the primary purpose of every soul's mortal life.</font><font size=-1></font>
                <p><font size=-1>That God may attend and prosper each of us on our way
                    to perfect liberty, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</font>
