                                    talk sometimes about free will. Is that a correct principle? Yes. And
                                    it is a principle that has always existed, and proceeded from God, our
                                    Heavenly Father. When God revealed himself to Joseph Smith, it was
                                    optional whether he obeyed his counsel or not. I suppose, however,
                                    looking at things as they exist, and as they are in truth, God
                                    understood that he would do it, he having been selected for that
                                    purpose a long, long time ago. And [I suppose] that the Lord knew that
                                    he would adhere to those principles and would carry out the designs of
                                    heaven as they should be communicated unto and required of him. <small>(<span

                                    great gift of agency, that is the privilege given to man to make his
                                    own choice, has never been revoked, and it never will be. It is an
                                    eternal principle giving freedom of thought and action to every soul.
                                    No person, by any decree of the Father, has ever been compelled to do
                                    good; no person has ever been forced to do evil. Each may act for
                                    himself. It was Satan's plan to destroy this agency and force men to do
                                    his will. There could be no satisfactory existence without this great
                                    gift. Men must have the privilege to choose even to the extent that
                                    they may rebel against the divine decrees. Of course salvation and
                                    exaltation must come through the free will without coercion and by
                                    individual merit in order that righteous rewards may be given and
                                    proper punishment be meted out to the transgressor. Therefore, when the
                                    great day of the Lord shall come, the wicked who have merited
                                    banishment from a righteous government will be consumed, or the
                                    privilege of continuance on the earth will be denied. <small>(<span

                                    and present the plan of redemption for the salvation of all of God's
                                    children. The council was called so that every man and woman could
                                    sustain the provisions of the Father's plan, which required that all
                                    people obtain mortal bodies, be tried and proven in all things, and
                                    have opportunity to choose of their own free will to obey the laws and
                                    ordinances essential to their exaltation. <small>(<span

                                    person must exercise his right of choice when he enters the Church. The

                                    doctrine and practice of the Church. After he has been taught, he asks
                                    with open eyes for admission to Church membership. Children are
                                    likewise taught the meaning of the ordinance, before they are baptized

                                    He accepts the organization, code of doctrine, and manner of living
                                    within the Church. As by the free exercise of his agency he seeks
                                    baptism, so by that agency he becomes subject to the order of life
                                    within the Church. The requirements of the Church are not in any sense
                                    infringements upon his right of choice. He has made his choice. The
                                    principles of truth upon which the Church rests must henceforth
                                    determine his actions and conduct in life. <small>(<span
