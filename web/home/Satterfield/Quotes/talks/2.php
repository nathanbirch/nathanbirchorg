                <h3 style="font-family: arial;" align="center"><strong><em>A
                Proclamation to the World</em></strong></h3>
                <span style="font-family: arial;">We, the First Presidency and the
                Council of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of
                Latter-Day Saints, solemnly proclaim that marriage between a man and a
                woman is ordained of
                God and that the family is central to the Creator's plan for the
                eternal destiny of his children. </span>
                <p style="font-family: arial;">All human beings -- male and female --
                are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit
                son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine
                nature and destiny. Gender
                is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal and
                eternal identity and purpose.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;">In the premortal realm, spirit sons and
                daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father
                and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical
                body and gain earthly
                experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize his or
                her divine destiny as an heir
                of eternal life. The divine plan of happiness enables family
                relationships to be perpetuated beyond
                the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples
                make it possible for
                individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be
                united eternally.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;">The first commandment that God gave to
                Adam and Eve pertained to their potential for
                parenthood as husband and wife. We declare that God's commandment for
                His children to
                multiply and replenish the earth remains in force. We further declare
                that God has commanded
                that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between
                man and woman, lawfully
                wedded as husband and wife.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;">We declare the means by which mortal
                life is created to be divinely appointed. We affirm the
                sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;">Husband and wife have a solemn
                responsibility to love and care for each other and for their
                children. "Children are an heritage of the Lord" (Psalms 127:3).
                Parents have a sacred duty to
                rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their
                physical and spiritual needs, to
                teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments
                of God and to be
                law-abiding citizens wherever they live. Husbands and wives -- mothers
                and fathers -- will be held
                accountable before God for the discharge of these obligations.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;">The family is ordained of God. Marriage
                between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are
                entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a
                father and a
                mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in
                family life is most likely to
                be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ.
                Successful marriages and
                families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer,
                repentance, forgiveness,
                respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities.
                By divine design, fathers
                are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are
                responsible to provide the
                necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are
                primarily responsible for the
                nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers
                and mothers are obligated to help
                one another as equal partners. Disability, death, or other
                circumstances may necessitate individual
                adaptation. Extended families should lend support when needed.
                </p>
                <p style="font-family: arial;">We warn that individuals who violate
                covenants of chastity, who abuse spouse or offspring, or
                who fail to fulfill family responsibilities will one day stand
                accountable before God. Further, we
                warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals,
                communities, and nations the
                calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.
                </p>
                <p><span style="font-family: arial;">We call upon responsible citizens
                and officers of government everywhere to promote those
                measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the
                fundamental unit of society.</span> </p>
