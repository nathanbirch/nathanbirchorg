                                    Heaven was fought, Lucifer, the son of the morning, came forth with a
                                    plan that was rejected. The Father of us all, with love for us, His
                                    children, offered a better plan under which we would have freedom to
                                    choose the course of our lives. His Firstborn Son, our Elder Brother,
                                    was the key to that plan. Man would have his agency, and with that
                                    agency would go accountability. Man would walk the ways of the world
                                    and sin and stumble. But the Son of God would take upon Himself flesh
                                    and offer Himself a sacrifice to atone for the sins of all men. Through
                                    unspeakable suffering He would become the great Redeemer, the Savior of
                                    all mankind. <small>(&#8220;We Look to Christ,&#8221; <span

                                    style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">We have reviewed the
                                    elements of moral agency and its divine origins, but we need to always
                                    remember that agency would have no meaning without the vital
                                    contribution of Jesus Christ. His central role began with His support
                                    of the Father&#8217;s plan and His willingness to become the essential Savior
                                    under that plan. The plan required a setting for its implementation,
                                    and Jesus was instrumental in the creation of this planet for that
                                    purpose. Most important, while the Fall of Adam was a critical element
                                    of the plan of salvation, the Fall would also have frustrated the plan
                                    if certain of its consequences were not mitigated by the Atonement and
                                    Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span></big><br
                                style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">

                                    It was necessary in God&#8217;s plan for our future happiness and glory that
                                    we become morally free and responsible. For that to happen, we needed
                                    an experience apart from Him where our choices would determine our
                                    destiny. The Fall of Adam provided the spiritual death needed to
                                    separate us from God and place us in this mortal condition, as well as
                                    the physical death needed to provide an end to the mortal experience.
                                    As Alma put it:</span></big><br

                                    &#8220;And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both
                                    temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we
                                    see they became subjects to follow after their own will&#8221; (Alma 42:7).</span></big><br

                                    Death had to be permitted, but it also had to be overcome or we could
                                    not return to the presence of God. Jacob, the brother of Nephi,
                                    explained:</span></big><br

                                    &#8220;For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of
                                    the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection. &#8230;</span></big><br

                                    become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the
                                    Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.</span></big><br

                                    angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to
                                    remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself. &#8230;</span></big><br

                                    &#8220;O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our
                                    escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death
                                    and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the
                                    spirit&#8221; (2 Nephi 9:6, 8&#8211;10).</span></big><br
                                style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">

                                    Thus, if our separation from God and our physical death were permanent,
                                    moral agency would mean nothing. Yes, we would be free to make choices,
                                    but what would be the point? The end result would always be the same no
                                    matter what our actions: death with no hope of resurrection and no hope
                                    of heaven. As good or as bad as we might choose to be, we would all end
                                    up &#8220;angels to a devil.&#8221;</span></big><br

                                    With resurrection through Jesus Christ, the Fall can achieve its
                                    essential purpose without becoming a permanent death sentence. &#8220;Hell
                                    must deliver up its captive spirits,&#8221; &#8220;the grave must deliver up its
                                    captive bodies,&#8221; and &#8220;the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits
                                    of the righteous&#8221; so that &#8220;the spirit and the body is restored to
                                    itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they
                                    are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh,
                                    save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect&#8221; (2 Nephi 9:12, 13).</span></big><br

                                    But there was one more thing that Christ needed to accomplish so that
                                    moral agency could have a positive potential. Just as death would doom
                                    us and render our agency meaningless but for the redemption of Christ,
                                    even so, without His grace, our sins and bad choices would leave us
                                    forever lost. There would be no way of fully recovering from our
                                    mistakes, and being unclean, we could never live again in the presence
                                    of the &#8220;Man of Holiness&#8221; (Moses 6:57; see also 3 Nephi 27:19).</span></big><br

                                    We cannot look to the law to save us when we have broken the law (see 2
                                    Nephi 2:5). We need a Savior, a Mediator who can overcome the effects
                                    of our sins and errors so that they are not necessarily fatal. It is
                                    because of the Atonement of Christ that we can recover from bad choices
                                    and be justified under the law as if we had not sinned.</span></big><br

                                    choose, we may, in fact, make wrong choices, bad choices, hurtful
                                    choices. And sometimes we do just that, but that is where the mission
                                    and mercy of Jesus Christ comes into full force and glory. He has taken
                                    upon himself the burden of all the world&#8217;s risk. He has provided a
                                    mediating atonement for the wrong choices we make. He is our advocate
                                    with the Father and has paid, in advance, for the faults and
                                    foolishness we often see in the exercise of our freedom. We must accept
                                    his gift, repent of those mistakes, and follow his commandments in
                                    order to take full advantage of this redemption. The offer is always
                                    there; the way is always open. We can always, even in our darkest hour

                                    Moral agency is a vital element in our Father in Heaven's plan of
                                    happiness. He understood that some of His spirit children would use
                                    that agency improperly, causing serious problems to others. Some would
                                    even violate sacred trust, such as a father or family member abusing an
                                    innocent child. Since our Heavenly Father is completely just, there has
                                    to be a way of overcoming the tragic consequences of such damaging use
                                    of agency for both the victim and the perpetrator. That secure healing
                                    comes through the power of the Atonement of His Beloved Son, Jesus
                                    Christ, to rectify that which is unjust. Faith in Jesus Christ and in
                                    His power to heal provides the abused with the means to overcome the
                                    terrible consequences of another's unrighteous acts. When combined with
                                    complete repentance, the Atonement also affords the perpetrator a way
                                    to avoid the severe punishment the Lord has decreed for such acts.</span></big><br

                                    To the Victim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I testify that I know victims of
                                    serious abuse who have successfully made the difficult journey to full
                                    healing through the power of the Atonement. After her own concerns were
                                    resolved by her faith in the healing power of the Atonement, one young
                                    woman who had been severely abused by her father requested another
                                    interview with me. She returned with an older couple. I could sense
                                    that she loved the two very deeply. Her face radiated happiness. She
                                    began, "Elder Scott, this is my father. I love him. He's concerned
                                    about some things that happened in my early childhood. They are no
                                    longer a problem for me. Could you help him?" What a powerful
                                    confirmation of the Savior's capacity to heal! She no longer suffered
                                    from the consequences of abuse, because she had adequate understanding
                                    of His Atonement, sufficient faith, and was obedient to His law. As you
                                    conscientiously study the Atonement and exercise your faith that Jesus
                                    Christ has the power to heal, you can receive the same blessed relief.
                                    During your journey of recovery, accept His invitation to let Him share
                                    your burden until you have sufficient time and strength to be healed.</span></big><br

                                    To find relief from the consequences of abuse, it is helpful to
                                    understand their source. Satan is the author of all of the destructive
                                    outcomes of abuse. He has extraordinary capacity to lead an individual
                                    into blind alleys where the solution to extremely challenging problems
                                    cannot be found. His strategy is to separate the suffering soul from
                                    the healing attainable from a compassionate Heavenly Father and a
                                    loving Redeemer.</span></big><br
                                style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">

                                    <br>
                                    If you have been abused, Satan will strive to convince you that there
                                    is no solution. Yet he knows perfectly well that there is. Satan
                                    recognizes that healing comes through the unwavering love of Heavenly
                                    Father for each of His children. He also understands that the power of
                                    healing is inherent in the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Therefore, his
                                    strategy is to do all possible to separate you from your Father and His
                                    Son. Do not let Satan convince you that you are beyond help.</span></big><br

                                    Satan uses your abuse to undermine your self-confidence, destroy trust
                                    in authority, create fear, and generate feelings of despair. Abuse can
                                    damage your ability to form healthy human relationships. You must have
                                    faith that all of these negative consequences can be resolved;
                                    otherwise they will keep you from full recovery. While these outcomes
                                    have powerful influence in your life, they do not define the real you.</span></big><br

                                    Satan will strive to alienate you from your Father in Heaven with the
                                    thought that if He loved you He would have prevented the tragedy. Do
                                    not be kept from the very source of true healing by the craftiness of
                                    the prince of evil and his wicked lies. Recognize that if you have
                                    feelings that you are not loved by your Father in Heaven, you are being
                                    manipulated by Satan. Even when it may seem very difficult to pray,
                                    kneel and ask Father in Heaven to give you the capacity to trust Him
                                    and to feel His love for you. Ask to come to know that His Son can heal
                                    you through His merciful Atonement.</span></big><br

                                    It was Satan's proposal that Father's children be forced to obey, that
                                    there be no moral agency and therefore no personal growth. To preserve
                                    moral agency, the Lord does not restrain individuals from improper use
                                    of that agency. However, He will punish them for such acts unless there
                                    is full repentance. Through the Holy Ghost, He sends warning promptings
                                    to the abuser, but often that individual's degrading appetite is so
                                    powerful that it blocks out that spiritual guidance. That is why our
                                    Father provided a way to heal the consequences of acts that, through
                                    force, misuse of authority, or fear of another, temporarily take away
                                    the agency of the abused.</span></big><br

                                    The beginning of healing requires childlike faith in the unalterable
                                    fact that Father in Heaven loves you and has supplied a way to heal.
                                    His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, laid down His life to provide that
                                    healing. But there is no magic solution, no simple balm to provide
                                    healing, nor is there an easy path to the complete remedy. The cure
                                    requires profound faith in Jesus Christ and in His infinite capacity to
                                    heal. It is rooted in an understanding of doctrine and a resolute
                                    determination to follow it.</span></big><br
                                style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">&nbsp;<br>
                                    Healing may begin with a thoughtful bishop or stake president or a wise
                                    professional counselor. If you had a broken leg, you wouldn't decide to
                                    fix it yourself. Serious abuse can also benefit from professional help.
                                    There are many ways to begin healing, but remember that a full cure
                                    comes through the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, our Master and
                                    Redeemer. Have faith that with effort His perfect, eternal, infinite
                                    Atonement can heal your suffering from the consequences of abuse.</span></big><br
                                style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial;">&nbsp;<br>
                                    As impossible as it may seem to you now, in time the healing you can
                                    receive from the Savior will allow you to truly forgive the abuser and
                                    even have feelings of sorrow for him or her. When you can forgive the
                                    offense, you will be relieved of the pain and heartache that Satan
                                    wants in your life by encouraging you to hate the abuser. As a result,
                                    you will enjoy greater peace. While an important part of healing, if
                                    the thought of forgiveness causes you yet more pain, set that step
                                    aside until you have more experience with the Savior's healing power in
                                    your own life.</span></big><br

                                    If you are currently being abused or have been in the past, find the
                                    courage to seek help. You may have been severely threatened or caused
                                    to fear so that you would not reveal the abuse. Have the courage to act
                                    now. Seek the support of someone you can trust. Your bishop or stake
                                    president can give you valuable counsel and help you with the civil
                                    authorities. Explain how you have been abused and identify who has done
                                    it. Ask for protection. Your action may help others avoid becoming
                                    innocent victims, with the consequent suffering. Get help now. Do not
                                    fear-for fear is a tool Satan will use to keep you suffering. The Lord
                                    will help you, but you must reach out for that help.</span></big><br

                                    Do not be discouraged if initially a bishop hesitates when you identify
                                    an abuser. Remember that predators are skillful at cultivating a public
                                    appearance of piety to mask their despicable acts. Pray to be guided in
                                    your efforts to receive help. That support will come. Rest assured that
                                    the Perfect Judge, Jesus the Christ, with a perfect knowledge of the
                                    details, will hold all abusers accountable for every unrighteous act.
                                    In time He will fully apply the required demands of justice unless
                                    there is complete repentance. Your preoccupation with a need for
                                    justice only slows your healing and allows the perpetrator to continue
                                    his abusive control. Therefore you should leave punishment for the
                                    diabolic acts of abuse to civil and Church authorities.<small> (&#8220;To
