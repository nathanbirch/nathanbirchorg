                            light
                            and life of the world, which proceedeth forth from the presence of God
                            throughout the immensity of space, the light and power of which God
                            bestows
                            in different degrees to "them that ask him," according to their faith
                            and
                            obedience, but the Holy Ghost, which Christ said He would send to His
                            apostles
                            from the Father (John 14:26) was and is a "personage of spirit," and
                            was
                            not to come until Christ went away (John 16:7). Also the endowment from
                            that divine being, the third person in the Holy Trinity, called "the
                            gift
                            of the Holy Ghost," is a special blessing sealed upon baptized
                            repentant
                            believers in Jesus Christ, and is "an abiding witness." The spirit of
                            God
                            may be enjoyed as a temporary influence by which divine light and power
                            come to mankind for special purposes and occasions. But the gift of the
                            Holy Ghost, which was received by the apostles on the day of Pentecost,
                            and is bestowed in confirmation, is a permanent witness and higher

                        and is beyond mortal comprehension. It is in us and in all things; it
                        is
                        around us and around all things; it fills the earth and the heavens and
                        the universe. It is everywhere, in all immensity, without exception; it
                        is an indwelling, immanent, ever-present, never-absent spirit. It has
                        neither
                        shape nor form nor personality. It is not an entity nor a person nor a
                        personage. It has no agency, does not act independently, and exists not
                        to act but to be acted upon. As far as we know, it has no substance and
                        is not material, at least as we measure these things. It is variously
                        described
                        as light and life and law and truth and power. It is the light of
                        Christ;
                        it is the life that is in all things; it is the law by which all things
                        are governed; it is truth shining forth in darkness; it is the power of
                        God who sitteth upon his throne. It may be that it is also priesthood
                        and
                        faith and omnipotence, for these too are the power of God.</big></font>

                            omnipresent in person than can the Father or the Son, but by his
                            intelligence,

                            he is and can be omnipresent throughout all the works of God. It is not
                            the Holy Ghost who in person lighteth every man who is born into the
                            world,
                            but it is the light of Christ, the Spirit of Truth, which proceeds from
                            the source of intelligence, which permeates all nature, which lighteth
                            every man and fills the immensity of space. You may call it the Spirit
                            of God, you may call it the influence of God's intelligence, you may
                            call
                            it the substance of his power, no matter what it is called, it is the

                            of intelligence that permeates the universe and gives to the spirits of
                            men understanding, just as Job has said. (Job 32:8; Doc. and Cov.

                                the confines of the more refined and subtle elements, it finds itself
                                associated with certain substances in themselves invisible to our gross
                                organs, but clearly manifested to our intellect by their tangible

                                very air we breathe, although invisible to our sight, is clearly
                                manifested to our sense of feeling. Its component parts may be
                                analyzed. Nay more, the human system itself is an apparatus which
                                performs a chemical process upon that element. It is received into the
                                system by the act of respiration, and there immediately undergoes the
                                separation of its component parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;"><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></big></big><br><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
                                one part, retained and incorporated in the animal system, diffuses life
                                and animation, by supplying the necessary animal heat, etc., while the
                                other part, not adapted to the system, is discharged from the lungs to
                                mingle with its native element.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;"><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></big></big><br><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;">There
                                are several of these subtle, invisible substances but little understood
                                as yet by man, and their existence is only demonstrated by their
                                effects. Some of them are recognized under several terms, electricity,
                                galvanism, magnetism, animal magnetism, spiritual magnetism, essence,
                                spirit, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;"><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>The

                                govern all matter, as before enumerated.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;"><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></big></big><br><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;">Like

                                requires time to move from one part of space to another, and can in no
                                wise occupy two spaces at once. In all these respects it differs
                                nothing from all other matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;"><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></big></big><br><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">This substance is widely diffused among the elements of space.</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153); text-decoration: underline;">This Holy Spirit, under the control of the Great Eloheim, is the grand moving cause of all intelligences, and by which they act.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;"><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></big></big><br><big><big><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">This

                            be omnipresent throughout all the works of God." Thus when it becomes
                            necessary
                            to speak to us, he is able to do so by acting through the other Spirit,
                            that is, through the Light of Christ. <small>(<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>,

                            POWER OF GOD. This
                            Light of Christ
                            is not a personage. It has no body. I do not know what it is as far as
                            substance is concerned; but it fills the immensity of space and
                            emanates
                            from God. It is the light by which the worlds are controlled, by which
                            they are made. It is the light of the sun and all other bodies. It is
                            the
                            light which gives life to vegetation. It quickens the understanding of
                            men, and has these various functions as set forth in these
                            verses.&nbsp;
                            It is: "The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all
                            things,
                            which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of
                            God
                            who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in
                            the midst of all things." This is our explanation in regard to the
                            Spirit
                            of Christ, or Light of Truth, which every man receives and is guided
                            by.
                            Unless a man had the blessings that come from this Spirit, his mind
                            would
                            not be quickened; there would be no vegetation grow; the worlds would
                            not
                            stay in their orbits; because it is through this Spirit of Truth, this
                            Light of Truth, according to this revelation, that all these things are
                            done. <small>(<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, 1:52)</small></big></font></big></li>

                            THROUGH THE LIGHT OF
                            CHRIST. The person
                            of the Holy Ghost can work through the Spirit of Christ that permeates
                            everything, or he can work by personal contacts. The Holy Ghost can act
                            through some other influence or force. This may be a crude
                            illustration,
                            and yet I think it answers our purpose. We have in this building a
                            young
                            lady sitting down at the switchboard. Someone on this floor wants to
                            get
                            in touch with someone on the second floor; somebody else in another
                            part
                            of the building wants to talk with someone in another building; and so
                            on. They are all connected with the parties they want to talk to. In a
                            similar way the Holy Ghost could speak to someone here, someone over
                            there,
                            and someone way off in some other part of the country, even in a
                            foreign
                            land, and each receive the message intended for him. That is not hard
                            to
                            understand when we think of telegraphy. They send several messages over
                            a wire at the same time. Radio stations send messages of different wave
                            lengths all over the earth. <small>(<i>Doctrines of Salvation</i>, 1:54)</small></big></font></big></li>

                            Not in the least, but the Spirit of the Lord, the Light of Christ, has
                            been back of it, and has been impelling them to do these very things;
                            and
                            why? Because the time is here; it is ripe. We are ready for these
                            discoveries,
                            these inventions, and they all have a bearing upon the restoration of
                            the
                            gospel and preparation for the time which is yet future, but which is
                            shortly
                            to come, when Christ shall reign on the earth, and for a thousand years
                            peace shall be established. That is what it is all for. Now, a man like
                            Edison may say, "I do not believe in a supreme being." I do not know
                            whether
                            he does or not; some of these men do not. However, the Lord in his
                            great
                            mercy, overlooks that and uses the man because he is adapted to a
                            certain
                            work, and he, through his Spirit, can inspire this man to do this great
                            work, and so he goes ahead and does it, all for the establishment of
                            the

                                Jesus Christ </span>[see Topical Guide, "Light of Christ," p. 290]. It gives

                            and life to all things. It prompts all rational individuals throughout
                            the earth to distinguish truth from error, right from wrong. It
                            activates

                        the sun gives life and light to the earth, a spiritual
                        light gives nourishment to our spirits. We call this the Light of
                        Christ.
                        The scriptures teach us that it "lighteth every man that cometh into
                        the
                        world" (John 1:9; see also Moro. 7:16; D&amp;C 84:46). Thus, all
                        mankind
                        can enjoy its blessings. The Light of Christ is the divine influence
                        that
                        allows every man, woman, and child to distinguish between good and
                        evil.
                        It encourages all to choose the right, to seek eternal truth, and to
                        learn
                        again the truths that we knew in our premortal existence but have
