                                    great gift of agency, that is the privilege given to man to make his
                                    own choice, has never been revoked, and it never will be. It is an
                                    eternal principle giving freedom of thought and action to every soul.
                                    No person, by any decree of the Father, has ever been compelled to do
                                    good; no person has ever been forced to do evil. Each may act for
                                    himself. It was Satan's plan to destroy this agency and force men to do
                                    his will. There could be no satisfactory existence without this great
                                    gift. Men must have the privilege to choose even to the extent that
                                    they may rebel against the divine decrees. Of course salvation and
                                    exaltation must come through the free will without coercion and by
                                    individual merit in order that righteous rewards may be given and
                                    proper punishment be meted out to the transgressor. Therefore, when the
                                    great day of the Lord shall come, the wicked who have merited
                                    banishment from a righteous government will be consumed, or the
                                    privilege of continuance on the earth will be denied. <small>(Answers

                                    had the power to choose even before you were born. In the premortal
                                    Council in Heaven, Heavenly Father presented His plan, which included
                                    the principle of agency. Lucifer rebelled and &#8220;sought to destroy the
                                    agency of man&#8221; (Moses 4:3). As a result, Lucifer and all those who
                                    followed him were denied the privilege of receiving a mortal body. Your
                                    presence on the earth confirms that you exercised your agency to follow
                                    Heavenly Father&#8217;s plan.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                    come. You are free to choose and act, but you are not free to choose
                                    the consequences of your actions. The consequences may not be
                                    immediate, but they will always follow. Choices of good and
                                    righteousness lead to happiness, peace, and eternal life, while choices
                                    of sin and evil eventually lead to heartache and misery. <small>(&#8220;Agency,&#8221;

                                    exercise our faith and our will, especially with a new physical body to
                                    master and control. But we know from both ancient and modern revelation
                                    that Satan wished to deny us our independence and agency in that

                                    choice, or agency, is an ultimate goal. For Latter-day Saints, this
                                    potential confusion is partly a product of the fact that moral
                                    agency&#8212;the right to choose&#8212;is a fundamental condition of mortal life.
                                    Without this precious gift of God, the purpose of mortal life could not
                                    be realized. To secure our agency in mortality we fought a mighty
                                    contest the book of Revelation calls a &#8220;war in heaven.&#8221; This premortal
                                    contest ended with the devil and his angels being cast out of heaven
                                    and being denied the opportunity of having a body in mortal life (see
                                    Rev. 12:7-9).</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    &nbsp;But our war to secure agency was won. The test in this postwar
                                    mortal estate is not to secure choice but to use it&#8212;to choose good
                                    instead of evil so that we can achieve our eternal goals. In mortality,
                                    choice is a method, not a goal.</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    Of course, mortals must still resolve many questions concerning what
                                    restrictions or consequences should be placed upon choices. But those
                                    questions come under the heading of freedom, not agency. Many do not
                                    understand that important fact. We are responsible to use our agency in
                                    a world of choices. It will not do to pretend that our agency has been
                                    taken away when we are not free to exercise it without unwelcome
                                    consequences.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    Because choice is a method, choices can be exercised either way on any
                                    matter, and our choices can serve any goal. Therefore, those who
                                    consider freedom of choice as a goal can easily slip into the position
                                    of trying to justify any choice that is made. &#8220;Choice&#8221; can even become
                                    a slogan to justify one particular choice. For example, today one who
                                    says &#8220;I am pro-choice&#8221; is clearly understood as opposing any legal
                                    restrictions upon a woman&#8217;&#8216;s choice to abort a fetus.</span></big><br

                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    More than 30 years ago, as a young law professor, I published one of
                                    the earliest articles on the legal consequences of abortion. Since that
                                    time I have been a knowledgeable observer of the national debate and
                                    the unfortunate Supreme Court decisions on the so-called &#8220;right to
                                    abortion.&#8221; I have been fascinated with how cleverly those who sought
                                    and now defend legalized abortion on demand have moved the issue away
                                    from a debate on the moral, ethical, and medical pros and cons of legal
                                    restrictions on abortion and focused the debate on the slogan or issue
                                    of choice. The slogan or sound bite &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; has had an almost
                                    magical effect in justifying abortion and in neutralizing opposition to
                                    it.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    Pro-choice slogans have been particularly seductive to Latter-day
                                    Saints because we know that moral agency, which can be described as the
                                    power of choice, is a fundamental necessity in the gospel plan. All
                                    Latter-day Saints are pro-choice according to that theological
                                    definition. But being pro-choice on the need for moral agency does not
                                    end the matter for us. Choice is a method, not the ultimate goal. We
                                    are accountable for our choices, and only righteous choices will move
                                    us toward our eternal goals.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    In this effort, Latter-day Saints follow the teachings of the prophets.
                                    On this subject our prophetic guidance is clear. The Lord commanded,
                                    &#8220;Thou shalt not &#8230; kill, nor do anything like unto it&#8221; (D&amp;C 59:6).
                                    The Church opposes elective abortion for personal or social
                                    convenience. Our members are taught that, subject only to some very
                                    rare exceptions, they must not submit to, perform, encourage, pay for,
                                    or arrange for an abortion. That direction tells us what we need to do
                                    on the weightier matters of the law, the choices that will move us
                                    toward eternal life.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    In today&#8217;s world we are not true to our teachings if we are merely
                                    pro-choice. We must stand up for the right choice. Those who persist in
                                    refusing to think beyond slogans and sound bites like pro-choice wander
                                    from the goals they pretend to espouse and wind up giving their support
                                    to results they might not support if those results were presented
                                    without disguise.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    For example, consider the uses some have made of the possible
                                    exceptions to our firm teachings against abortion. Our leaders have
                                    taught that the only possible exceptions are when the pregnancy
                                    resulted from rape or incest, or when a competent physician has
                                    determined that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy
                                    or that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to
                                    survive beyond birth. But even these exceptions do not justify abortion
                                    automatically. Because abortion is a most serious matter, we are
                                    counseled that it should be considered only after the persons
                                    responsible have consulted with their bishops and received divine
                                    confirmation through prayer.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    Some Latter-day Saints say they deplore abortion, but they give these
                                    exceptional circumstances as a basis for their pro-choice position that
                                    the law should allow abortion on demand in all circumstances. Such
                                    persons should face the reality that the circumstances described in
                                    these three exceptions are extremely rare. For example, conception by
                                    incest or rape&#8212;the circumstance most commonly cited by those who use
                                    exceptions to argue for abortion on demand&#8212;is involved in only a tiny
                                    minority of abortions. More than 95 percent of the millions of
                                    abortions performed each year extinguish the life of a fetus conceived
                                    by consensual relations. Thus the effect in over 95 percent of
                                    abortions is not to vindicate choice but to avoid its consequences.
                                    Using arguments of &#8220;choice&#8221; to try to justify altering the consequences
                                    of choice is a classic case of omitting what the Savior called &#8220;the
                                    weightier matters of the law.&#8221;</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    A prominent basis for the secular or philosophical arguments for
                                    abortion on demand is the argument that a woman should have control
                                    over her own body. Not long ago I received a letter from a thoughtful
                                    Latter-day Saint outside the United States who analyzed that argument
                                    in secular terms. Since his analysis reaches the same conclusion I have
                                    urged on religious grounds, I quote it here for the benefit of those
                                    most subject to persuasion on this basis:</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    &#8220;Every woman has, within the limits of nature, the right to choose what
                                    will or will not happen to her body. Every woman has, at the same time,
                                    the responsibility for the way she uses her body. If by her choice she
                                    behaves in such a way that a human fetus is conceived, she has not only
                                    the right to but also the responsibility for that fetus. If it is an
                                    unwanted pregnancy, she is not justified in ending it with the claim
                                    that it interferes with her right to choose. She herself chose what
                                    would happen to her body by risking pregnancy. She had her choice. If
                                    she has no better reason, her conscience should tell her that abortion
                                    would be a highly irresponsible choice.</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    &#8220;What constitutes a good reason? Since a human fetus has intrinsic and
                                    infinite human value, the only good reason for an abortion would be the
                                    violation or deprivation of or the threat to the woman&#8217;s right to
                                    choose what will or will not happen to her body. Social, educational,
                                    financial, and personal considerations alone do not outweigh the value
                                    of the life that is in the fetus. These considerations by themselves
                                    may properly lead to the decision to place the baby for adoption after
                                    its birth, but not to end its existence in utero.</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    &#8220;The woman&#8217;s right to choose what will or will not happen to her body
                                    is obviously violated by rape or incest. When conception results in
                                    such a case, the woman has the moral as well as the legal right to an
                                    abortion because the condition of pregnancy is the result of someone
                                    else&#8217;s irresponsibility, not hers. She does not have to take
                                    responsibility for it. To force her by law to carry the fetus to term
                                    would be a further violation of her right. She also has the right to
                                    refuse an abortion. This would give her the right to the fetus and also
                                    the responsibility for it. She could later relinquish this right and
                                    this responsibility through the process of placing the baby for
                                    adoption after it is born. Whichever way is a responsible choice.&#8221;</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    The man who wrote those words also applied the same reasoning to the
                                    other exceptions allowed by our doctrine&#8212;life of the mother and a baby
                                    that will not survive birth.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    I conclude this discussion of choice with two more short points.</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                                    &nbsp;If we say we are anti-abortion in our personal life but
                                    pro-choice in public policy, we are saying that we will not use our
                                    influence to establish public policies that encourage righteous choices
                                    on matters God&#8217;s servants have defined as serious sins. I urge

                                    other grievous sins should be decriminalized or smiled on by the law
                                    due to this theory that persons should not be hampered in their
                                    choices. Should we decriminalize or lighten the legal consequences of
                                    child abuse? of cruelty to animals? of pollution? of fraud? of fathers
                                    who choose to abandon their families for greater freedom or convenience?</span></big><br

                                    Similarly, some reach the pro-choice position by saying we should not
                                    legislate morality. Those who take this position should realize that
                                    the law of crimes legislates nothing but morality. Should we repeal all
                                    laws with a moral basis so that our government will not punish any
                                    choices some persons consider immoral? Such an action would wipe out
                                    virtually all of the laws against crimes. <small>(&#8220;Weightier Matters,&#8221;

                                    Joseph Smith was told to expect some severe opposition despite making
                                    good choices. Said the Lord, &#8220;Know thou, my son, that all these things

                                    We are in a mortal experience because we cannot become as God without
                                    that experience. We must prove to Him and to ourselves that we can
                                    consistently make the right choices and then stick to those choices,
                                    come what may.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                    Some think that they should be spared from any adversity if they keep
                                    God&#8217;s commandments, but it is &#8220;in the furnace of affliction&#8221; (Isaiah
                                    48:10; 1 Nephi 20:10) that we are chosen. The Lord&#8217;s promise is not to
                                    spare us the conflict but to preserve and console us in our afflictions
                                    and to consecrate them for our gain (see 2 Nephi 2:2; 4:19&#8211;26; Jacob

                                    Exercising agency in a setting that sometimes includes opposition and
                                    hardship is what makes life more than a simple multiple-choice test.
                                    God is interested in what we are becoming as a result of our choices.
                                    He is not satisfied if our exercise of moral agency is simply a robotic
                                    effort at keeping some rules. Our Savior wants us to become something,
                                    not just do some things. He is endeavoring to make us independently
                                    strong&#8212;more able to act for ourselves than perhaps those of any prior
                                    generation. We must be righteous, even when He withdraws His Spirit,
                                    or, as President Brigham Young said, even &#8220;in the dark.&#8221;</span></big><br

                                    Using our agency to choose God&#8217;s will, and not slackening even when the
                                    going gets hard, will not make us God&#8217;&#8217;s puppet; it will make us like
                                    Him. God gave us agency, and Jesus showed us how to use it so that we
                                    could eventually learn what They know, do what They do, and become what
                                    They are.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                    Remember that with His gift of moral agency, our Heavenly Father has
                                    graciously provided us help to exercise that agency in a way that will
                                    yield precious, positive fruit in our life here and hereafter. Among
                                    other resources, we have the scriptures that contain the fulness of the
                                    gospel of Jesus Christ, mentors and parents who love us, the voice of
                                    prophets and apostles living among us, the covenants and ordinances of
                                    the priesthood and the temple, the gift of the Holy Ghost, prayer, and
                                    the Church. May we draw upon these resources constantly to guide our

                                    the message of the Restoration, we learn that during our mortal life
                                    our agency is tested through the inseparable connection of our spirit
                                    with the elements of this earth, "the flesh," or the "natural man" (see
                                    D&amp;C 88:15). By this revelation we not only understand the cause of
                                    mankind's misery, but we also receive the keys and power that enable us
                                    to end this misery once and for all. As our mind is opened through our
                                    study of the plan of salvation, each of us comes to see that our life
                                    means that the "real me," or "the spiritual child of God," created in
                                    innocence and beauty, is engaged in a fight for life or death with the
                                    elements of the earth, the "flesh," which, in its present unredeemed
                                    state, is enticed and influenced by the enemy of God. </span></big><br

                                    From the revelations of the Book of Mormon, we know that this enemy
                                    fights with all fury and cunningness to make all men miserable like
                                    unto himself (see 2 Ne. 2:27). It is Jesus Christ who, through His
                                    light, is searching and finding each individual child of God who is
                                    yearning and fighting for righteousness and truth and who is crying for
                                    help. Without Christ, this war within us is lost. Without Christ&#8217;s plan
                                    of redemption and His atoning sacrifice, we all would have been lost.
                                    We knew that before we came to this earth, and we can sense it again,
                                    when through the Light of Christ our minds are quickened with
                                    understanding (see D&amp;C 88:11).</span></big><br

                                    The issue is truth, my dear brothers and sisters, and the only way to
                                    find truth is through uncompromising self-education toward self-honesty
                                    to see the original &#8220;real me,&#8221; the child of God, in its innocence and
                                    potential in contrast to the influence from the other part of me, &#8220;the
                                    flesh,&#8221; with its selfish desires and foolishness. Only in that state of
                                    pure honesty are we able to see truth in its complete dimension.
                                    Honesty may not be everything, but everything is nothing without
                                    honesty. In its final state, honesty is a gift of the Spirit through
                                    which the true disciples of Christ feel the force to bear testimony of
                                    the truth in such a powerful way that it penetrates the very core of
                                    our existence. ...</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                    This war is a war that has to be fought by all of Heavenly Father&#8217;&#8217;s
                                    children, whether they know about it or not. But without a keen
                                    knowledge of the plan of salvation, and without the influence of the
                                    divine Light of Christ to bring us awareness, this war is being fought
                                    subconsciously, and therefore its battlefronts are not even known to
                                    us, and we have no chance to win. Wars in the inner self that are
                                    fought subconsciously, with unknown battlefronts, lead to defeats which
                                    also hurt us subconsciously. These defeats are reflected in our
                                    conscious life as expressions of misery, such as a lack of
                                    self-confidence, lack of happiness and joy, lack of faith and
                                    testimony, or as overreactions of our subconscious self, which we see
                                    then as pride, arrogance, or in other forms of misbehavior&#8212;even as acts

                                    One of the great tragedies we see in our lives is that the adversary,
                                    through the influences of our &#8220;flesh,&#8221; can cheat us into establishing
                                    images of truth or perceptions of truth. Our brain, the great computer
                                    where all the facts of life&#8217;&#8217;s memories are held together, can also be
                                    programmed by the &#8220;flesh,&#8221; with its self-centered ideas to deceive the
                                    spiritual self. Without the constant striving through prayer and
                                    contemplation to reach the ends of self-awareness and honesty, our
                                    so-called intellect can, therefore, based on look-alike truths, play

                                    to manipulate truth with the vain results of deceit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>

                                agency, and no man is deprived by any power of God from exercising it
                                in the fullest and in the freest manner. This agency has been given to
                                all. This is a blessing that God has bestowed upon the world of
                                mankind, upon all His children alike. But He will hold us strictly to
                                an account for the use that we make of this agency... <small>(<span

                                    then, are the elements of moral agency? To me there are three.</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">First</span>, there must be
                                    alternatives among which to choose. Lehi spoke of opposites, or
                                    &#8220;opposition&#8221; &#8211;righteousness and its opposite, wickedness; holiness
                                    versus misery; good versus bad. Without opposites, Lehi said, &#8220;All
                                    things must needs be a compound in one; &#8230; no life neither death, nor
                                    corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor
                                    insensibility&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:11).</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                    He further explained that for these opposites or alternatives to exist,
                                    there must be law. Law provides us the options. It is by the operation
                                    of laws that things happen. By using or obeying a law, one can bring
                                    about a particular result&#8211;and by disobedience, the opposite result.
                                    Without law there could be no God, for He would be powerless to cause
                                    anything to happen (see 2 Nephi 2:13). Without law, neither He nor we
                                    would be able to predict or choose a particular outcome by a given
                                    action. Our existence and the creation around us are convincing
                                    evidence that God, the Creator, exists and that our mortal world
                                    consists of &#8220;both things to act and things to be acted upon&#8221; (2 Nephi
                                    2:14)&#8211;or, in other words, choices.</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Second,</span> for us to have agency,
                                    we must not only have alternatives, but we must also know what they
                                    are. If we are unaware of the choices available, the existence of those
                                    choices is meaningless to us. Lehi called this being &#8220;enticed by the
                                    one or the other&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:16). He recalled the situation of Adam and
                                    Eve in the Garden of Eden when they were presented with a choice,&#8220;even
                                    the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being
                                    sweet and the other bitter&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:15). Adam and Eve&#8217;s choice, of
                                    course, brought about the Fall, which brought with it a knowledge of
                                    good and evil, opening to their understanding a multitude of new
                                    choices. Had they remained in Eden, &#8220;they would have remained in a
                                    state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no
                                    good, for they knew no sin&#8221;&nbsp; (2 Nephi 2:23). But with the Fall,
                                    both they and we gain sufficient knowledge and understanding to be
                                    enticed by good and evil&#8211;we attain a state of accountability and can
                                    recognize the alternatives before us.</span></big><br
                                style="font-family: arial;">
                            <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                    The beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ is that it pours knowledge
                                    into our souls and shows things in their true light. With that enhanced
                                    perspective, we can discern more clearly the choices before us and
                                    their consequences. We can, therefore, make more intelligent use of our
                                    agency. Many of God&#8217;s children fall into unanticipated traps and
                                    unhappiness because they either lack or ignore gospel light. They are
                                    unaware of their options or are confused about the outcomes of their
                                    choices. Ignorance effectively limits their agency.</span></big><br

                                    agency: the freedom to make choices (see 2 Nephi 10:23). This freedom
                                    to act for ourselves in choosing among alternatives is often referred
                                    to in the scriptures as agency itself. For this freedom we are indebted
                                    to God. It is His gift to us (see Moses 4:3).</span></big><br

                                    &#8220;The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the
                                    workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in
                                    the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his

                                    King Benjamin reminded us that in addition to giving us the freedom to
                                    choose, God makes it possible for us to use the gift because He &#8220;is
                                    preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live
                                    and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you
                                    from one moment to another&#8221; (Mosiah 2:21).</span></big><br

                                    Freedom of choice is the freedom to obey or disobey existing laws&#8211;not
                                    the freedom to alter their consequences. Law, as mentioned earlier,
                                    exists as a foundational element of moral agency with fixed outcomes
                                    that do not vary according to our opinions or preferences. Elder Dallin
                                    H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles observed, &#8220;We are
                                    responsible to use our agency in a world of choices. It will not do to
                                    pretend that our agency has been taken away when we are not free to
                                    exercise it without unwelcome consequences.&#8221; [Dallin H. Oaks,

                                    you ask, why does God, if He truly loves his children, permit Satan to
                                    tempt us and thereby jeopardize our chances to gain the best
                                    experiences in mortality and return to enjoy eternal life in His
                                    presence? The answer is given by a great prophet-teacher:&nbsp;
                                    &#8220;Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself.
                                    Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was
                                    enticed by the one [which is evil] or the other [which is good].&#8221; (2
                                    Nephi 2:16.)&nbsp; Think about that for a moment. If there were no
                                    opposition to good, would there be any chance to exercise your agency
                                    or right to choose? To deny you that privilege would be to deny you the
                                    opportunity to grow in knowledge, experience, and power. God has given
                                    laws with penalties affixed so that man might be made afraid of sin and
                                    be guided into paths of truth and duty. (See Alma 42:20.) <small>(<span

                                    tend to think of agency as a personal matter. If we ask someone to
                                    define "moral agency," the answer will probably be something like this:
                                    "Moral agency means I am free to make choices for myself." Often
                                    overlooked is the fact that choices have consequences; we forget also
                                    that agency offers the same privilege of choice to others. At times we
                                    will be affected adversely by the way other people choose to exercise
                                    their agency. Our Heavenly Father feels so strongly about protecting
                                    our agency that he allows his children to exercise it, either for good

                                    probably think you have found a new freedom: to think wholly for
                                    yourself, to make wholly your own determinations, to criticize and
                                    decide for yourself what is right and wrong. That was decided
                                    eternities ago. Right and wrong are not to be determined by you or me.
                                    Those elements were decided for us before our birth. We have the free
                                    agency to do the right or do the wrong, but who are we to alter those
                                    changeless things? We can scoff at sacred things, express our own
                                    little opinions, but remember that millions of men and women with
                                    keener minds than ours, with more erudite training than yours and mine,
                                    have said things and done things more startling, more ugly, more
                                    skeptical than you or I could think of. Millions have gone down the
                                    path you are entering. They have all come to grief or will ultimately.

                                    Jesus Christ. He has a perfect right to tell us so. We have no right to
                                    refuse. I do not care who the man is; I do not care where he lives, or

                                    no right to refuse to receive it. He has the privilege. He is not
                                    compelled to receive it, because our Father in heaven has given to
                                    everyone of us in the Church and out, the gift of free agency. That
                                    free agency gives us the privilege to accept and be loyal to our Lord&#8217;s
                                    commandments, but it has never given us the right to reject them. Every
                                    man who rejects the commandments of our Father in heaven is rebellious.

                                    was arguing, as men and women have falsely argued from the beginning of
                                    time, that to take counsel from the servants of God is to surrender
                                    God-given rights of independence. But the argument is false because it
                                    misrepresents reality. When we reject the counsel which comes from God,
                                    we do not choose to be independent of outside influence. We choose
                                    another influence. We reject the protection of a perfectly loving,
                                    all-powerful, all-knowing Father in Heaven, whose whole purpose, as
                                    that of His Beloved Son, is to give us eternal life, to give us all
                                    that He has, and to bring us home again in families to the arms of His
                                    love. In rejecting His counsel, we choose the influence of another
                                    power, whose purpose is to make us miserable and whose motive is
                                    hatred. We have moral agency as a gift of God. Rather than the right to
                                    choose to be free of influence, it is the inalienable right to submit
                                    ourselves to whichever of those powers we choose. <small>(&#8220;Finding

                                    Eternal Father defined truth and established what is right and wrong
                                    before the creation of this earth. He also fixed the consequences of
                                    obedience and disobedience to those truths. He defended our right to
                                    choose our path in life so that we would grow, develop, and be happy,
                                    but we do not have the right to choose the consequences of our acts.
                                    ... Please understand, no one has the privilege to choose what is
                                    right. God reserved that prerogative to Himself. Our agency does allow
                                    us to choose among alternate paths, but then we are bound to the
                                    consequence God has decreed. Later, if we don&#8217;t like where the path
                                    takes us, the only out is through repentance. <small>(&#8220;Healing Your

                                    opened unto the eyes of him.&#8221; (Heb. 4:12&#8211;13.)</span></big><br

                                    In other words, God judges us not only for our acts, but also for the
                                    desires of our hearts. He has said so again and again. This is a
                                    challenging reality, but it is not surprising. Agency and
                                    accountability are eternal principles. We exercise our free agency not
                                    only by what we do, but also by what we decide, or will, or desire.
                                    Restrictions on freedom can deprive us of the power to do, but no one
                                    can deprive us of the power to will or desire. Accountability must
                                    therefore reach and attach consequences to the desires of our
                                    hearts.&nbsp; <small>(&#8220;The Desires of Our Hearts,&#8221; <span

                                    When others give you advice, have you ever said, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t believe

                                    self-will cannot change truth. Satan knows that, so he tries to create

                                    choose what to do, but can determine what is right to do. Satan strives
                                    to persuade us to live outside truth by rationalizing our actions as

                                    But our Eternal Father defined truth and established what is right and
                                    wrong before the creation of this earth. He also fixed the consequences
                                    of obedience and disobedience to those truths. He defended our right to
                                    choose our path in life so that we would grow, develop, and be happy,
                                    but we do not have the right to choose the consequences of our acts.
                                    Those who willfully, consistently disobey His commandments will
                                    inevitably learn that truth. Joseph Smith was inspired to record, &#8220;When
                                    we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon
                                    which it is predicated.&#8221; (D&amp;C 130:21.)</span></big><br

                                    Please understand, no one has the privilege to choose what is right.
                                    God reserved that prerogative to Himself. Our agency does allow us to
                                    choose among alternate paths, but then we are bound to the consequence
                                    God has decreed. Later, if we don&#8217;t like where the path takes us, the

                                    proper exercise of moral agency requires faith. Faith in the Lord Jesus
                                    Christ is the first principle of the gospel. (See A of F 1:4.) Because
                                    of Him, you have your agency. He must be the very foundation of your
                                    faith, and the testing of that faith is a fundamental reason for your

                                    You are free to develop and exercise faith in God and in His divine
                                    Son, faith in His word, faith in His Church, faith in His servants, and
                                    faith in His commandments. ...</span></big><br

                                    Holy Ghost, who will help you make wise decisions. (See 2 Ne. 2:27-28;

                                    Many may profess a measure of faith in God, but without sincere
                                    repentance, faith cannot be fully operative. This concept was made
                                    known to the Nephites:</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                                    &#8220;Many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the truth, &#8230; and are
                                    led to believe the holy scriptures, &#8230; which leadeth them to faith on
                                    the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance bringeth a
                                    change of heart unto them." (Hel. 15:7.)</span></big><br

                                    Faith, repentance, and obedience will qualify you for sublime gifts of
                                    justice and mercy, which are bestowed upon those worthy of the
                                    blessings of the Atonement. (See Alma 34:16-17.)</span></big><br

                                    Yes, every test, every trial, every challenge and hardship you endure
                                    is an opportunity to further develop your faith. (See D&amp;C 63:11;

                                    &nbsp;Faith can be fortified through prayer. Prayer is the powerful key
                                    to making decisions, not only concerning your physical body, but
                                    concerning all other important aspects of your life. Humbly seek the
                                    Lord in prayer with a sincere heart and real intent, and He will help
                                    you. (See Alma 33:23; Moro. 7:9; Moro. 10:4; D&amp;C 9:7-9.)</span></big><br

                                    Remember that faith and prayer alone are seldom sufficient. Personal
                                    effort is usually necessary to accomplish your heart's desire. "Faith,
                                    if it hath not works, is dead, being alone." (James 2:17; see also

                                    one I think of often but one I seldom talk about. I shall not mention
                                    it in detail; I only want to refer to it. It happened many years ago
                                    when I was perhaps not quite as young as you are now, and it had to do
                                    with my decision to follow that guide.</span></big><br

                                    I knew what agency was and knew how important it was to be individual
                                    and to be independent, to be free. I somehow knew there was one thing
                                    the Lord would never take from me, and that was my free agency. I would
                                    not surrender my agency to any being but to Him! I determined that I
                                    would give Him the one thing that He would never take&#8212;my agency. I
                                    decided, by myself, that from that time on I would do things His way.</span></big><br

                                    That was a great trial for me, for I thought I was giving away the most
                                    precious thing I possessed. I was not wise enough in my youth to know
                                    that because I exercised my agency and decided myself, I was not losing
                                    it. It was strengthened!&nbsp; <small>(&#8220;Spiritual Crocodiles,&#8221; <span
