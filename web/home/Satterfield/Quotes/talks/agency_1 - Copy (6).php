                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span style="font-family: arial;">While
                            perhaps it is seldom, if ever, contended that either political
                            independence or economic freedom alone brings perfect liberty, it is
                            not, however, uncommon for free agency to be considered as synonymous
                            with freedom of the soul. And it is true that the God-given right to
                            choose one&#8217;s course of action is an indispensable prerequisite to such
                            freedom. Without it we can scarcely enjoy any type of
                            liberty&#8212;political, economic, or personal. It is one of our greatest
                            heritages. ...</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Free agency, however, precious as it is, is not of itself the perfect
                            liberty we seek, nor does it necessarily lead thereto. As a matter of
                            fact, through the exercise of their agency more people have come to
                            political, economic, and personal bondage than to liberty.</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            The Nephites, for example, at one time, by the exercise of their
                            agency, brought themselves to such a state of affairs that their only
                            course led to political bondage. This they did while living under a
                            government providing for the freest exercise of agency. &#8220;Their laws and
                            their governments,&#8221; says the record, &#8220;were established by the voice of
                            the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they who
                            chose good.&#8221; Therefore, &#8220;they could not be governed by the law nor
                            justice, save it were to their destruction.&#8221; (Hel. 5:2&#8211;3.) Under these
                            circumstances, they chose as rulers wicked men, who would certainly
                            destroy their political liberties, to replace righteous men who had in
                            the past protected and preserved those liberties and would have
                            continued to do so in the future. ...</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            With respect to the loss of personal liberty through the misuse of free
                            agency, our daily lives are filled with tragic evidence. We see the
                            alcoholic with his craving for drink, the dope fiend in his frenzy, and
                            worse, the pervert with his irretrievable loss of manhood. Who will say
                            that such persons enjoy liberty?</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Notwithstanding the fact that through its misuse, political, economic,
                            and personal liberty are lost, free agency will always endure because
                            it is an eternal principle. However, the free agency possessed by any
                            one person is increased or diminished by the use to which he puts it.
                            Every wrong decision one makes restricts the area in which he can
                            thereafter exercise his agency. The further one goes in the making of
                            wrong decisions in the exercise of free agency, the more difficult it
                            is for him to recover the lost ground. One can, by persisting long
                            enough, reach the point of no return. He then becomes an abject slave.
                            By the exercise of his free agency, he has decreased the area in which
                            he can act, almost to the vanishing point. ...</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            These poor souls have placed themselves in the power of Lucifer and his
                            followers, who, as you remember, became Perdition. (See D&amp;C 76:26.)
                            Their final fate is to be cast out into outer darkness, such punishment
                            being the natural consequence of the alternatives they elected in the
                            exercise of their agency. The fact that they were originally endowed by
                            their Creator with free agency does not save them from the most awful
                            bondage, the bondage of sin.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Just as following wrong alternatives restricts free agency and leads to
                            slavery, so pursuing correct alternatives widens the scope of one&#8217;s
                            agency and leads to perfect liberty. As a matter of fact, one may, by
                            this process, obtain freedom of the soul while at the same time being
                            denied political, economic, and personal liberty.&nbsp; For example,
                            consider the Prophet Joseph Smith. Here was a man enjoying freedom of
                            the soul while suffering the deprivation of almost every other liberty.

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span style="font-family: arial;">First,
                            because free agency is a God-given precondition to the purpose of
                            mortal life, no person or organization can take away our free agency in
                            mortality.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Second, what can be taken away or reduced by the conditions of
                            mortality is our freedom, the power to act upon our choices.&nbsp; Free
                            agency is absolute, but in circumstances of mortality freedom is always
                            qualified.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Freedom may be qualified or taken away (1) by physical laws, including
                            the physical limitations with which we are born, (2) by our own
                            actions, and (3) by the actions of others, including governments.</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Lehi taught his son Jacob that &#8220;men are free [have freedom] according
                            to the flesh&#8221; (2 Nephi 2:27).&nbsp; For example, in the flesh we are
                            subject to the physical law of gravity.&nbsp; If I should hang from the
                            catwalk in the Marriott Center and release my grip, I would not be free
                            to will myself into a soft landing.&nbsp; And I cannot choose to run
                            through a brick wall.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            A loss of freedom reduces the extent to which we can act upon our
                            choices, but it does not deprive us of our God-given free agency. ...</span></big><br

                            Interferences with our freedom do not deprive us of our free
                            agency.&nbsp; When Pharaoh put Joseph in prison, he restricted Joseph&#8217;s
                            freedom, but he did not take away his free agency.&nbsp; When Jesus
                            drove the money changers out of the temple, he interfered with their
                            freedom to engage in a particular activity at a particular time in a
                            particular place, but he did not take away their free agency.&nbsp; <small>(&#8220;Free

                            Every choice one makes either expands or contracts the area in which he

                            becomes a habit. Sin is intensely habit-forming and sometimes moves men

                            forgiveness, and without forgiveness all the blessings of eternity hang
                            in jeopardy. As the transgressor moves deeper and deeper in his sin,

                            Recently I met an intelligent young man with great potential. He was
                            undecided about a mission. He has decided not to attend a university
                            now. In his free time he only does what he likes to do. He doesn&#8217;t work
                            because he doesn&#8217;t have to, and it would take time from pleasure. He
                            passed seminary classes without much thought of personally applying the
                            knowledge gained. I noted: &#8220;You are making choices today that appear to
                            give you what you want: an easy life, abundant enjoyment, and not much
                            sacrifice. You can do that for a while, yet every decision you make
                            narrows your future. You are eliminating possibilities and options.
                            There will come a time, and it won&#8217;t be too distant, where you are
                            going to spend the rest of your life doing things you don&#8217;t want to do,
                            in places you don&#8217;t want to be, because you have not prepared yourself.

                            these latter days, as in the times of old, we must avoid being acted
                            upon by acting for ourselves to avoid evil. The Holy Ghost will prompt
                            us. Joseph was told to flee from Potiphar&#8217;s wife. Abraham obeyed the
                            commandment to flee out of the land of Ur. Lehi was instructed to flee
                            Jerusalem before it was destroyed. And to protect the Savior&#8217;s life,
                            Mary and Joseph were prompted to flee into Egypt.</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            The promptings that come to us to flee evil reflect our Heavenly
                            Father&#8217;s understanding of our particular strengths and weaknesses and
                            His awareness of the unforeseen circumstances of our lives. When these
                            promptings come, they will not generally stop us in our tracks, for the
                            Spirit of God does not speak with a voice of thunder. The voice will be
                            as soft as a whisper, coming as a thought to our minds or a feeling in
                            our hearts. By heeding its gentle promptings, we will be protected from
                            the destructive consequences of sin.</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            But if we ignore those promptings, the light of the Spirit will fade.
                            Our agency will be limited or lost, and we will lose the confidence and
                            ability to act. We will be &#8220;walking in [spiritual] darkness at
                            noon-day.&#8221; [D&amp;C 95:6] Then how easy it is to wander into strange
                            paths and become lost! How quickly we are bound in the chains of sin
                            spoken of by Lehi to his rebellious sons [see 2 Ne. 1:13].&nbsp; For
                            example, if we make choices that put us deeply in debt, we will lose
                            our agency to meet our wants and needs or to save for that inevitable
                            rainy day. If we choose to break the law, we may be put in prison,
                            where our agency is so limited that we cannot choose where we go, who
                            we see, or what we do. Spirit prison is very much like that. Therefore,
                            to retain our agency we must daily walk in the light of our Lord and
                            Savior and follow the path of obedience. It is the only path that leads
                            to our Father in Heaven. <small>(&#8220;To Act for Ourselves: The Gift and

                            the secular world it seems a paradox that greater submission to God
                            yields greater freedom. The world looks at things through Korihor&#8217;s
                            lens, considering obedience to God&#8217;&#8217;s laws and ordinances to be
                            &#8220;bondage&#8221; (Alma 30:24, 27). So how do obedience and truth make us free?
                            We can easily think of some practical ways in which truth gives us the
                            ability to do things we otherwise could not do or to avoid disasters we
                            might otherwise suffer.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                            A young British girl learned in school about the characteristics of
                            water along a shoreline that signal the approach of a tsunami. Two
                            weeks later, on vacation with her family in Thailand, she observed
                            those phenomena and insistently warned her parents and the people
                            around her. They escaped to higher ground just in time when the
                            December 26, 2004, tsunami hit south Asia. More than a hundred people
                            owe their lives to that girl&#8217;s knowledge of certain truths of the
                            natural world. [See &#8220;Girl Honored for Saving Lives with Pre-Tsunami

                            But the Lord&#8217;s statement that the truth will make us free has broader
                            significance. &#8220;Truth,&#8221; He tells us, &#8220;is knowledge of things as they
                            are, and as they were, and as they are to come&#8221; (D&amp;C 93:24).
                            Possession of this knowledge of things past, present, and future is a
                            critical element of God&#8217;s glory: &#8220;The glory of God is intelligence, or,
                            in other words, light and truth&#8221; (D&amp;C 93:36). Does anyone doubt
                            that, as a consequence of possessing all light and truth, God possesses
                            ultimate freedom to be and to do?</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Likewise, as our understanding of gospel doctrine and principles grows,
                            our agency expands. First, we have more choices and can achieve more
                            and receive greater blessings because we have more laws that we can
                            obey. Think of a ladder&#8211;each new law or commandment we learn is like
                            one more rung on the ladder that enables us to climb higher. Second,
                            with added understanding we can make more intelligent choices because
                            we see more clearly not only the alternatives but also their potential
                            outcomes. As Professor Daniel H. Ludlow once expressed it, &#8220;The extent
                            of our individual &#8230; agency &#8230; is in direct proportion to the number and
                            kind of laws we know and keep.&#8221; [Daniel H. Ludlow, &#8220;Moral Free Agency,&#8221;

                            These are magnificent promises: to be filled with light and truth, to
                            comprehend all things, to be glorified in truth and know all things,
                            and to come even unto the Father. I have no doubt regarding the literal

                            choose obedience, but along with you, I recognize that they are not
                            realized in a day. Much obedience and experience are required before we
                            enjoy a fulness. We should, however, be encouraged by what John said of
                            the Savior:</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
