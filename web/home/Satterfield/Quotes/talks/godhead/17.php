                            There is a spirit -- the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of Christ, the
                            light
                            of truth, the light of Christ -- that defies description and is beyond
                            mortal
                            comprehension. It is in us and in all things; it is around us and
                            around all
                            things; it fills the earth and the heavens and the universe. It is
                            everywhere,
                            in all immensity, without exception; it is an indwelling, immanent,
                            ever-present, never-absent spirit. It has neither shape nor form nor
                            personality. It is not an entity nor a person nor a personage. It has
                            no agency,
                            does not act independently, and exists not to act but to be acted upon.
                            As far
                            as we know, it has no substance and is not material, at least as we
                            measure
                            these things. It is variously described as light and life and law and
                            truth and
                            power. It is the light of Christ; it is the life that is in all things;
                            it is
                            the law by which all things are governed; it is truth shining forth in
                            darkness;
                            it is the power of God who sitteth upon his throne. It may be that it
                            is also
                            priesthood and faith and omnipotence, for these too are the power of
                            God.</big></big></p>
                    <big><big></big></big>
                    <p><big><big>This light of truth or light of Christ is seen in the
                            light of the luminaries
                            of heaven; it is the power by which the sun, moon, and stars, and the
                            earth
                            itself are made. It is the light that proceedeth forth from the
                            presence of God
                            to fill the immensity of space." It is "the light which is in all
                            things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all
                            things
                            are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is
                            in the
                            bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things." It is the agency
                            of
                            Godâ€™s power; it is the means and way whereby "he comprehendeth all
                            things," so that "all things are before him, and all</big></big></p>
                    <big><big></big></big>
                    <p><big><big>things are round about him." It is the way whereby "he is
                            above all
                            things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round
                            about all
                            things." Because of it, "all things are by him, and of him, even God,
                            forever and ever." (D&amp;C 88:6-13, 41.)</big></big></p>
                    <big><big></big></big>
                    <p><big><big>Thus, when the Mosaic account of the creation says that
                            "the Spirit of
                            God moved upon the face of the waters" (Genesis 1:2), and when Abraham
                            records of those same events that "the Spirit of the Gods was brooding
                            upon
                            the face of the waters" (Abraham 4:2), the revealed word is speaking of
                            the
                            light of Christ. And when Job says that "by his spirit [the Lord] hath
                            garnished the heavens" (Job 26:13), and the Psalmist explains that all
                            things were created because the Lord sent forth his spirit, by which
                            also he
                            "renewest the face of the earth" (Psalm 104:30), both are teaching the
                            same truth. Creation itself came by the light of Christ.</big></big></p>
                    <big><big></big></big>
                    <p><big><big>The light of Christ is neither the Holy Ghost nor the gift
                            of the Holy Ghost;
                            but that member of the Godhead, because he along with the Father and
                            the Son is
                            God, uses the light of Christ for his purposes. Thus spiritual gifts,
                            the gifts
                            of God meaning faith, miracles, prophecy, and all the rest -- come from
                            God by
                            the power of the Holy Ghost. Men prophesy, for instance, when moved
                            upon by the
                            Holy Ghost. And yet Moroni says: "All these gifts come by the Spirit of
                            Christ" (Moroni 10:17), meaning that the Holy Ghost uses the light of
                            Christ to transmit his gifts. But the Spirit of Christ, by which the
                            Holy Ghost
                            operates, is no more the Holy Ghost himself than the light and heat of
                            the sun
                            are the sun itself.</big></big></p>
