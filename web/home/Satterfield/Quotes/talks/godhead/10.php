                <p>
                <p>Let every person be the friend of God. 4:372.
                <p>Some believe or conceive the idea that to know God would lessen him
                    in our estimation; but I can say that for me to understand any principle
                    or being, on earth or in heaven, it does not lessen its true value to me,
                    but on the contrary, it increases it; and the more I can know of God, the
                    dearer and more precious he is to me, and the more exalted are my feelings
                    towards him. 13:57.
                <p>There is a Power that has organized all things from the crude matter
                    that floats in the immensity of space. He has given form, motion and life
                    to this material world; has made the great and small lights that bespangle
                    the firmament above; has allotted to them their times and their seasons,
                    and has marked out their spheres. He has caused the air and the waters
                    to teem with life, and covered the hills and plains with creeping things,
                    and has made man to be a ruler over his creations. All these wonders are
                    the works of the Almighty Ruler of the universe, in whom we believe and
                    whom we worship. 11:120.
                <p>All the creations are his work, and they are for his glory and for the
                    benefit of the children of men; and all things are put into the possession
                    of man for his comfort, improvement and consolation, and for his health,
                    wealth, beauty and excellency. 13:151.
                <p>He is a God of system, order, law, science, and art; a God of knowledge
                    and of power. 13:309.
                <p>He is the Father, God, Savior, Maker, Preserver, and Redeemer of man.
                    He holds in his hands the issue of all things and will judge every man
                    according to his works. 3:259-260.
                <p>God is the source, the fountain of all intelligence, no matter who possesses
                    it, whether man upon the earth, the spirits in the spirit-world, the angels
                    that dwell in the eternities of the Gods, or the most inferior intelligence
                    among the devils in hell. All have derived what intelligence, light, power,
                    and existence they have from God -- from the same source from which we
                    have received ours. 8:205.
                <p>Every good and perfect gift cometh from God. Every discovery in science
                    and art, that is really true and useful to mankind has been given by direct
                    revelation from God, though but few acknowledge it. It has been given with
                    a view to prepare the way for the ultimate triumph of truth, and the redemption
                    of the earth from the power of sin and Satan. We should take advantage
                    of all these great discoveries, the accumulated wisdom of ages, and give
                    to our children the benefit of every branch of useful knowledge, to prepare
                    them to step forward and efficiently do their part in the great work. 9:369.
                <p>He is our Heavenly Father; he is also our God, and the Maker and upholder
                    of all things in heaven and on earth. He sends forth his counsels and extends
                    his providences to all living. He is the Supreme Controller of the universe.
                    At his rebuke the sea is dried up, and the rivers become a wilderness.
                    He measures the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meteth out heaven
                    with a span, and comprehendeth the dust of the earth in a measure, and
                    weigheth the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance; the nations
                    to him are as a drop in a bucket, and he taketh up the isles as a very
                    little thing; the hairs of our heads are numbered by him, and not a sparrow
                    falleth to the ground without our Father; and he knoweth every thought
                    and intent of the hearts of all living, for he is everywhere present by
                    the power of his Spirit -- his minister, the Holy Ghost. He is the Father
                    of all, is above all, through all, and in you all; he knoweth all things
                    pertaining to this earth, and he knows all things pertaining to millions
                    of earths like this. 11:41.
                <p>Whether they make good or bad use of it, all power is ordained of God
                    and is in his hand. He sets up a kingdom here, and pulls down another there
                    at his pleasure. He breaks the nations like a potter's vessel; he forms
                    a nucleus, and around it builds up a kingdom or nation, permitting the
                    people to act upon their own agency, that they may do right, or corrupt
                    themselves, as did the Children of Israel; and after they have become ripe
                    for destruction, they will be scattered to the four winds. If the people
                    of God in ancient days had continued holy they would have continued in
                    power and authority to this day. 7:148.
                <p>If there is anything that is great and good and wise among men, it cometh
                    from God. If there are men who possess great ability as statesmen, or as
                    philosophers, or who possess remarkable scientific knowledge and skill,
                    the credit thereof belongs to God, for he dispenses it to his children
                    whether they believe in him or not, or whether they sin against him or
                    not; it makes no difference; but all will have to account to him for the
                    way and manner in which they have used the talents committed unto them.
                    If we believe the plain, broad statements of the Bible, we must believe
                    that Jesus Christ is the light that lighteth every man that cometh into
                    the world; none are exempt. 11:123
                <p>The fulness of the heavens and the earth is the Lord's -- the gold and
                    the silver, the wheat, the fine flour, and the cattle upon a thousand hills;
                    and when we fully understand his works, we shall know that he is in all
                    the earth, and fulfills his will among the children of men, exalting and
                    debasing them according to his pleasure, for the systems, creeds, thrones,
                    and kingdoms of the world are all under his control. 1:49.
                <p>We believe that God is round about all things, above all things, in
                    all things, and through all things. To tell about empty space is to tell
                    of a space where God is not, and where the wicked might safely hide from
                    his presence. There is not such a thing as empty space. 1:276.
                <p>He is compassionate to all the works of his hands, the plan of his redemption,
                    and salvation, and mercy is stretched out over all; and his plans are to
                    gather up, and bring together, and save all the inhabitants of the earth,
                    with the exception of those who have received the Holy Ghost, and sinned
                    against it. With this exception, all the world besides shall be saved.
                    3:92.
                <p>When the Lord fights the battles of the Saints, he does it so effectually
                    that nobody gets nervous but the enemy. 8:325.
                <p>No person deceives the Lord. 16:163.
                <p>It is written that God knows all things and has all power. He has the
                    rule and command of this earth, and is the Father of all the human beings
                    that have lived, do live and will live upon it. If any of his children
                    become heirs to all things, they in their turn can say, by-and-by, that
                    they know all things, and they will be called Supreme, Almighty, King of
                    kings, Lord of lords. All this and more that cannot enter into our hearts
                    to conceive is promised to the faithful, and are but so many stages in
                    that ceaseless progression of eternal lives. This will not detract anything
                    from the glory and might of our Heavenly Father. For he will still remain
                    our Father, and we shall still be subject to him, and as we progress in
                    glory and power, the more it enhances the glory and power of our Heavenly
                    Father. This principle holds good in either state, whether mortal or immortal.
                    10:5.
                <p>All that the Lord requires of us is a perfect submission in our hearts
                    to his will. 18:238.
                <p>The Lord gives us little by little and is ever willing to give us more
                    and more, even the fulness, when our hearts are prepared to receive all
                    the truths of heaven. This is what the Lord desires, what he would delight
                    in doing, for his children. 18:217.
                <p>Our Father in heaven wishes us to preserve that which he gives to us.
                    9:169.
                <p>He presides over the worlds on worlds that illuminate this little planet,
                    and millions on millions of worlds that we cannot see; and yet he looks
                    upon the minutest object of his creations; not one of these creatures escapes
                    his notice; and there is not one of them but his wisdom and power has produced.
                    1:39.
                <p>I believe in a God who has power to exalt and glorify all who believe
                    in him, and are faithful in serving him to the end of their lives, for
                    this make them Gods, even the sons of God, and in this sense also there
                    are Gods many, but to us there is but one God, and one Lord Jesus Christ
                    -- one Savior who came in the meridian of time to redeem the earth and
                    the children of men from the original sin that was committed by our first
                    parents, and bring to pass the restoration of all things through his death
                    and suffering, open wide to all believers the gates of life and salvation
                    and exaltation to the presence of the Father and the Son to dwell with
                    them for evermore. 11:122.
                <p>As I said once to my brethren in the School of the Prophets, I have
                    not asked you, I dare not ask you to fulfil almost the first requirement
                    of the Kingdom of Heaven, almost the simplest principle, and one of the
                    first things that should be observed. I have not asked the people to perform
                    this great labor, I will say it is a great labor, and if I were to refer
                    it to you, you would say the same. You may ask what it is? It is to love
                    the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy mind and with all thy
                    strength, and thy neighbor as thyself. Now, is this not almost one of the
                    first requirements that God has made of his people? And I have not yet
                    required it of the people. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
                    then speak evil of thy neighbor? No! No! Love the Lord thy God with all
                    thy heart, and speak that which is not true? No, oh, no! Love the Lord
                    thy God with all thy heart, and take that which is not thy own? No, no,
                    no! Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and seek after riches of
                    the world and forsake your religion? No! Love the Lord thy God with all
                    thy heart and take his name in vain, curse and swear? No, never! If the
                    love of God was really in the hearts of all who call themselves Latter-day
                    Saints, there would be no more swearing, no more lying, no more deceiving,
                    no more speaking evil of one another, no more running after the ungodly
                    nor dealing with the enemies of Zion, no more running after the gold mines;
                    nothing would be sought after, only to build up the Kingdom of God. This
                    we have not yet asked. But we do ask some things. Let us forsake those
                    sins that are so grievous, and let us try to do right before the Heavens
                    and with each other. 12:229.
                <p>He has not committed the keys of the results of the acts of the nations
                    of the earth to any man on the earth; but that power he retains to himself.
                    8:31.
                <p>What is commonly termed idolatry has arisen from a few sincere men,
                    full of faith and having a little knowledge, urging upon a backsliding
                    people to preserve some customs -- to cling to some fashions or figures,
                    to put them in mind of that God with whom their fathers were acquainted,
                    without designing or wishing the people to worship an idol -- to worship
                    stocks, stones, beasts, and birds. Idols have been introduced, which are
                    now worshiped, and have been for centuries and thousands of years; but
                    they were not introduced at once. They were introduced to preserve among
                    the people the idea of the true God. 6:194.
                <p>We are nothing, only what the Lord makes us. 5:343.
                <p>Cease bringing the names of God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ
                    into disrespect and learn to reverence those names. 7:147.
                <p>The Lord operates upon the principles of continuing to organize, of
                    adding to, gathering up, bringing forth, increasing and spreading abroad;
                    while the opposite power does not. It shows the nature of his opposition
                    to that peculiar trait of Christianity, based upon the principles of eternal
                    duration, increase, power, glory, and exaltation; and points out the difference
                    between the two adverse powers. 1:117.
                <p>Unless God blesses our exertions we shall have nothing. It is the Lord
                    that gives the increase. 3:331.
                <p>The God that I serve is progressing eternally, and so are his children:
                    they will increase to all eternity, if they are faithful. 11:286.
                <p>It is written, "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good." Refuse
                    evil, choose good, hate iniquity, love truth. All this our fathers have
                    done before us; I do not particularly mean Father Adam, or his Father;
                    I do not particularly mean Abraham, or Moses, the Prophets, or Apostles,
                    but I mean our fathers who have been exalted for millions of years previous
                    to Adam's time. They have all passed through the same ordeals we are now
                    passing through, and have searched all things, even to the depths of hell.
                    9:243.
                <p>The great architect, manager and superintendent, controller and dictator
                    who guides this work is out of sight to our natural eyes. He lives on another
                    world; he is in another state of existence; he has passed the ordeals we
                    are now passing through; he has received an experience, has suffered and
                    enjoyed, and knows all that we know regarding the toils, sufferings, life
                    and death of this mortality, for he has passed through the whole of it,
                    and has received his crown and exaltation and holds the keys and the power
                    of this Kingdom; he sways his scepter, and does his will among the children
                    of men, among Saints and among sinners, and brings forth results to suit
                    his purpose among kingdoms and nations and empires, that all may redound
                    to his glory and to the perfection of his work. 11:249.
                <p>How many Gods there are, I do not know. But there never was a time when
                    there were not Gods and worlds, and when men were not passing through the
                    same ordeals that we are now passing through. That course has been from
                    all eternity, and it is and will be to all eternity.
                <p>You cannot comprehend this, but when you can, it will be to you a matter
                    of great consolation. 7:333.
                <p>Wherever the human family dwell upon the face of the earth, whether
                    they are savage or civilized, there is a desire implanted within them to
                    worship a great Supreme Ruler, and not knowing him they suppose that through
                    offering worship and sacrifice to their idols they can conciliate his anger
                    which they think they see manifested in the thunder, in the lightning,
                    in the storm, in the floods, in the reverses of war, in the hand of death,
                    etc., etc.; thus they try to woo his protection and his blessing for victory
                    over their enemies, and at the termination of this life for a place in
                    the heaven their imaginations have created, or tradition has handed down
                    to them. I have much charity for this portion of the human family called
                    heathens or idolators; they have made images to represent to their eyes
                    a power which they cannot see, and desire to worship a Supreme Being through
                    the figure which they have made. 11:120.
                <p>We believe in one God, one Mediator and one Holy Ghost. We cannot believe
                    for a moment that God is destitute of body, parts, passions, or attributes.
                    Attributes can be made manifest only through an organized personage. All
                    attributes are couched in and are the results of organized existence. 10:192.
                <p>The Lord is perfectly independent. He has received his glory, he reigns
                    supreme and omnipotent. He is not dependent upon you and me. If every one
                    of us should apostatize and go down to hell, it would neither add to nor
                    diminish from his glory. He would mourn at our folly in turning away from
                    the holy commandments and suffering the wrath of the Almighty to come upon
                    us; the heavens would weep over us, but still the Lord has his glory, and
                    you and I are not laboring for his benefit. For whose benefit are we laboring?
                    For our own. All my preaching, laboring and toils in this Kingdom have
                    been for myself, to get into the Celestial Kingdom of God. I have been
                    laboring for that and nothing else. 13:315.
                <p>Read the history of any kingdom or nation, and trace through all the
                    channels from the history of nations and kingdoms to that of families and
                    individuals who have not known God nor observed his commandments, and you
                    will find that sorrow and disappointment have been intimately mingled in
                    all the gaiety, luxuries, and pretended enjoyments of their mortal lives.
                    They have found a bitter sting in their happiest moments and a deadly poison
                    in their cups. 6:39.
                <p>There is no influence, truth, or righteousness in the world, only what
                    Bows from God our Father in the heavens. 5:78.
                    <br>&nbsp;
                <p><b>Personality and Fatherhood of God</b>
                <p>Some would have us believe that God is present everywhere. It is not
                    so. He is no more every where present in person than the Father and Son
                    are one in person. 6:345.
                <p>God is considered to be everywhere present at the same moment; and the
                    Psalmist says, "Whither shall I flee from thy presence?" He is present
                    with all his creations through his influence, through his government, spirit
                    and power, but he himself is a personage of tabernacle, and we are made
                    after his likeness. 10:319.
                <p>Our God and Father in Heaven, is a being of tabernacle, or, in other
                    words, he has a body, with parts the same as you and I have; and is capable
                    of showing forth his works to organized beings, as for instance, in the
                    world in which we live, it is the result of the knowledge and infinite
                    wisdom that dwell in his organized body. His Son Jesus Christ has become
                    a personage of tabernacle, and has a body like his Father. The Holy Ghost
                    is the Spirit of the Lord, and issues forth from himself, and may properly
                    be called God's minister to execute his will in immensity; being called
                    to govern by his influence and power; but he is not a person of flesh as
                    we are, and as our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ are. 1:50.
                <p>The Kingdom of God on earth is a living, moving, effective institution,
                    and is governed, controlled, dictated and led by the invisible God whom
                    we serve who is an exalted, living being, possessing body, parts and passions,
                    who listens to the prayers of his Saints, is a reasonable, merciful and
                    intelligent being, who is filled with knowledge and wisdom, who is full
                    of light and glory, and the foundations of whose throne are laid in eternal
                    truth; whose personal form is perfect in proportion and beauty. He loves
                    the good, and is angry with the wicked every day as it is written in the
                    Scriptures. He hates the evil that is done by evildoers, and is merciful
                    to the repenting sinner. He is beloved by all who know him for the attributes
                    he possesses in and of himself, in common with all glorified beings who
                    now dwell with him, and who will yet be glorified and crowned with crowns
                    of glory, immortality and eternal lives. 11:251.
                <p>It must be that God knows something about temporal things, and has bad
                    a body and been on an earth. Were it not so, he would not know how to judge
                    men righteously, according to the temptations and sin they have had to
                    contend with. 4:271.
                <p>Our Father in Heaven begat all the spirits that ever were, or ever will
                    be, upon this earth; and they were born spirits in the eternal world. Then
                    the Lord by his power and wisdom organized the mortal tabernacle of man.
                    We were made first spiritual, and afterwards temporal. 1:50.
                <p>He is our Father; he is our God, the Father of our spirits; he is the
                    framer of our bodies, and set the machine in successful operation to bring
                    forth these tabernacles that I now look upon in this building, and all
                    that ever did or ever will live on the face of the whole earth. 13:250.
                <p>The Apostles and Prophets, when speaking of our relationship to God,
                    say that we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone, God is our Father,
                    and Jesus Christ is our Elder Brother, and both are our everlasting friends.
                    6:332.
                <p>The kingdoms he possesses and rules over are his own progeny. Every
                    man who is faithful and gets a salvation and glory, and becomes a King
                    of kings and Lord of lords, or a Father of fathers, it will be by the increase
                    of his own progeny. Our Father and God rules over his own children. Wherever
                    there is a God in all the eternities possessing a kingdom and glory and
                    power it is by means of his own progeny. 11:262.
                <p>Many have tried to penetrate to the First Cause of all things; but it
                    would be as easy for an ant to number the grains of sand on the earth.
                    It is not for man, with his limited intelligence, to grasp eternity in
                    his comprehension. There is an eternity of life, from which we were composed
                    by the wisdom and skill of Superior Beings. It would be as easy for a gnat
                    to trace the history of man back to his origin as for man to fathom the
                    First Cause of all things, lift the veil of eternity, and reveal the mysteries
                    that have been sought after by philosophers from the beginning. What then,
                    should be the calling and duty of the children of men? Instead of inquiring
                    after the origin of Gods -- instead of trying to explore the depths of
                    eternities that have been, that are, and that will be, instead of endeavoring
                    to discover the boundaries of boundless space, let them seek to know the
                    object of their present existence, and how to apply, in the most profitable
                    manner for their mutual good and salvation, the intelligence they possess.
                    Let them seek to know and thoroughly understand things within their reach,
                    and to make themselves well acquainted with the object of their being here,
                    by diligently seeking unto a super-power for information and by the careful
                    study of the best books. 7:284-5.
                <p>God has given this great variety of intelligence. He has also given
                    this great variety of forms -- that eternal variety which we see upon this
                    earth, not only among human beings, but in every class of all the creations
                    of God; and they are all designed to be preserved to all eternity. None
                    of them were made to be destroyed, except those that do not abide the law
                    given them. 8:8.
                <p>I now see before me beings who are in the image of those heavenly personages
                    who are enthroned in glory and crowned with eternal lives in the very image
                    of those beings who organized the earth and its fulness, and who constitute
                    the Godhead. 9:246.
