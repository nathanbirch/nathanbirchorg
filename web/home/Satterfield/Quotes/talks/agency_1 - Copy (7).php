                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span style="font-family: arial;">When
                            we understand what is right and what is wrong, we are in a position to
                            exercise our freedom in making choices. In so doing, we must stand
                            accountable for our decisions, and we cannot escape the inevitable
                            consequences of these choices. Such freedom to exercise moral agency is
                            essential in an environment where people have the highest prospects for
                            progress and development.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            By our very endowment as children of an Eternal Father, we have had
                            implanted within our souls the urgency to be free. It is natural for us
                            to want to be accountable for our own fates, because there is a
                            whispering within us confirming that this accountability is absolutely
                            essential to the attainment of our eternal destiny.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            The existence of laws, regulations, and procedures has never been
                            sufficient to compel men to obedience. Productive obedience comes
                            through the exercise of free will. ...</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            ... Today we are being encouraged to accept greater responsibility for
                            the allocation of our time, for our spiritual development through
                            personal and family study of the gospel, and for giving loving
                            Christian service. We must be willing to respond to this new challenge.
                            Our willingness to accept this added accountability will exert an
                            influence that will reach far beyond our Sunday worship service and
                            religious life.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Unless we retain a vibrant desire to be free, and unless we understand
                            and practice the principles that give life to essential freedoms, we
                            have little reason to hope they will endure. If we allow ourselves to
                            accept dependency and regulation and to cease valuing independence and
                            self-accountability, then we are vulnerable to the forces that destroy
                            freedom. If righteousness is judged primarily by the degree to which
                            one responds to programmed activity, then a condition develops within
                            which opportunities for progress decline. The resulting tragedy affects
                            the mortal potential of man and has a profound effect on his eternal
                            possibilities as well.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Programmed behavior cannot produce the level of spiritual development
                            required to qualify one for eternal life. A necessary range of freedom
                            and self-determination is essential to one&#8217;s spiritual development.
                            With an understanding of correct principles and an intrinsic desire to
                            apply them, one must be motivated within himself to do many good things
                            of his own free will; for, as the revelation says, the power is in him
                            wherein he is an agent unto himself (see D&amp;C 58:27&#8211;28).</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            In preserving our freedom for self-determination, we cannot ignore the
                            need for carefully ordered structure and procedure within government or
                            any other organization. A careful balance must be maintained between
                            that which is ordered for the welfare of the group and that which is
                            reserved for the conscience and the incentive of the individual.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            This necessary balance of freedom and restraint is essential to right
                            relationships within families and communities, and it cannot be ignored
                            in our assignments within the Church.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            I have pondered the injunctions that have come to us in recent months
                            from leaders of the Church to simplify and reduce the number of
                            programmed activities prescribed for the members. There seems to be a
                            sensitivity to the need for maintaining this essential balance. We have
                            heard increased emphasis given to the need for individual initiative
                            and accountability within families. In his concluding remarks at the
                            April 1979 general conference, President Kimball said:</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            &#8220;The basic decisions needed for us to move forward, as a people, must
                            be made by the individual members of the Church. The major strides
                            which must be made by the Church will follow upon the major strides to
                            be made by us as&nbsp; individuals. &#8230; </span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            &#8220;&#8230; Our individual spiritual growth is the key to major numerical growth
                            in the kingdom&#8221; (Ensign, May 1979, p. 82).</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            I rejoice in the spirit and intent of this instruction from a living
                            prophet. I see in it the purposeful effort to preserve our individual
                            accountability in the context of our Church membership and religious
                            life.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            When members of the Church exercise self-determination in their
                            application of gospel principles they need not relax in their
                            compliance with these principles. In fact, optimum progress can only
                            occur when conditions are ideal for it, and these conditions must
                            include the necessary degree of freedom and self-accountability.
                            Anything less will guarantee stunted spiritual growth.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            We must understand that as freedom for unrestricted development is
                            enhanced, the possibilities for failure are also increased. The risk
                            factor is great. The ideal cannot be achieved otherwise. Celestial
                            attainment can be reached in no other environment. <small>(&#8220;Self-Accountability
