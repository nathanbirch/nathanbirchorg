                        music.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>I speak from the Seattle
                        Institute of Religion here rather than from one of our Church schools
                        to demonstrate our equal concern for all the youth of the Church. It is
                        not
                        possible for us to provide schools for all who are worthy and qualified
                        to attend. You are all very precious to the Lord. He will bless you
                        wherever you are as you seek to live
                        the gospel.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>In my mind's eye I can see
                        you, I'm sure well over 40 thousand of you, gathered in many locations.
                        Many of you attend Church schools. Many more of you are enrolled in
                        Institutes of Religion. You who are not students are equally important
                        and you are invited to enroll in classes at the Institutes of Religion.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>You are young, and I am not.
                        We regard you as Paul did Timothy when he wrote,</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>"let no man despise thy
                        youth." (1 Timothy 4:12-16)</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>David was young when he met
                        Goliath who, supposing that David was afraid, taunted him saying, "Come
                        to me." David answered, "Wait till I get a little bolder (boulder)--a
                        smooth one." Goliath, the scriptures say, "disdained him: for he was
                        but a youth." When David swung his sling, that was the first solid idea
                        that had ever entered Goliath's
                        head.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>King Saul had armed David
                        with his helmet of brass and his coat of mail. But "David said unto
                        Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put
                        them
                        off him.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>"Then said David to the
                        Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with
                        a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts." (1
                        Samual

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>You young adults have
                        invisible Goliaths to conquer, both physical and spiritual Goliaths.
                        You will need to be trained how to protect yourself against them.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>When you were children, you
                        went through a program of immunization. Antibodies were injected into
                        your system to protect you should you be exposed to contagions, an
                        enemy so small as to be invisible.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Until recent years, one was
                        required to carry an International Certificate of Vaccination when
                        traveling abroad. That certificate recorded your immunization against
                        certain
                        diseases, and one was required to present it with a passport at the
                        ticket counter. Without it you were not allowed to board a plane
                        destined for some countries.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>On one occasion, about
                        midnight, I handed my passport and certificate of vaccination to an
                        agent in Los Angeles. I was told that one immunization had expired and
                        I would
                        not be allowed to board the flight.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>What to do? Upon learning
                        that there was an all-night clinic near the airport, I rushed there by
                        cab, received the injection, had my record stamped, and raced back to
                        catch
                        the plane.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Thereafter I was more careful
                        to check my records. Even after the regulations loosened up, we still
                        pay sensible attention to protecting ourselves when traveling abroad. I
                        do not know how many times I have been exposed to, yet spared from,
                        serious illness by having submitted to the momentary discomfort of an
                        inoculation.</big></font></big></p>

                        body from contagious diseases with the proper serum, we cannot immunize

                        spirits with ideas, with truth.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>It is my purpose to do just
                        that, inoculate you with an idea, a truth, which, if admitted into your
                        thinking and into the cradle of your feelings, may protect you against
                        wicked

                        life, from birth to death, conforms to eternal law and follows a plan
                        described in the revelations as The Great Plan of Happiness. The one
                        idea, the
                        one truth I would inject into your minds is this:</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>There are three parts to the
                        plan. You are in the second or the middle part, the one in which you
                        will be tested by temptation, by trials, perhaps by tragedy. Understand
                        that,
                        and you will be better able to make sense of life and to resist the

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>The plan of redemption, with
                        its three divisions, might be likened to a grand three-act play. Act I
                        is entitled "Premortal Life." The scriptures describe it as our First
                        Estate.
                        (See Jude 1:6; Abr. 3:26-28) Act II, from birth to the time of
                        resurrection, the "Second Estate." And Act III, "Life After Death or
                        Eternal Life."</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>In mortality, we are like one
                        who enters a theater just as the curtain goes up on the second act. We
                        have missed Act I. The production has many plots and sub-plots that
                        interweave, making it difficult to figure out who relates to whom and
                        what relates to what, who are the heros and who are the villains. It is
                        further complicated because you
                        are not just a spectator; you are a member of the cast, on stage, in
                        the middle of it all!</big></font></big></p>

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big><strong>MEMORY VEILED</strong></big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>As part of the eternal plan,
                        the memory of our premortal life, Act I, is covered with a veil. Since
                        you enter mortality at the beginning of Act II with no recollection of
                        Act I, it is
                        little wonder that it is difficult to understand what is going on.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>That loss of memory gives us
                        a clean start. It is ideal for the test; it secures our individual
                        agency, and leaves us free to make choices. Many of them must be made
                        on faith
                        alone. Even so, we carry with us some whispered knowledge of our
                        premortal life and our status as offspring of immortal parents.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>You were born in innocence,
                        for "every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning" (D&amp;C
                        93:33). And you have an inborn sense of right and wrong, for the
                        scriptures tell us
                        in the Book of Mormon, we "are instructed sufficiently that [we] know
                        good from evil." (2 Nephi 2:5)</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>We progress or we are held
                        back in life within the limits imposed by spiritual and natural law
                        which govern all the universe. We sometimes wonder, if the plan really
                        is the
                        great plan of happiness, why must we struggle to find fulness of it in
                        mortal life?</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>If you expect to find only
                        ease and peace and bliss during Act II, you surely will be frustrated.
                        You will understand little of what is going on and why it is permitted
                        to be as
                        they are.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Remember this! The line "And
                        they all lived happily ever after" is never written into the second
                        act. That Line belongs in the third act when the mysteries are solved
                        and
                        everything is put right. The Apostle was right when he said, "If in
                        this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
                        miserable." (1 Corinthians 15:19.)</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Until you have a broad
                        perspective of the eternal nature of this great drama, you won't make
                        much sense out of the inequities in life. Some are born with so little
                        and others
                        with so much, some in poverty, with handicaps, with pain, with
                        suffering, premature death even of innocent children. There are the
                        brutal, unforgiving forces of nature and
                        the brutality of man to man. We've seen a lot of that recently.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Do not suppose that God
                        willfully causes that, which for His own purposes, he permits. When you
                        know the plan and purpose of it all, even these things will manifest a
                        loving Father in Heaven.</big></font></big></p>

                        is not
                        much detail, it makes clear the purpose of it all. And it reveals
                        enough of the plot to help you figure out what life is all about.</big></font></big></p>

                        already know, is the scriptures, the revelations. Read them, study
                        them. They tell you "what man is," why God is "mindful of him," and why
                        we are
                        made a little lower than the angels" or as Joseph Smith translated it,
                        "a little less than the Gods, and yet "crowned ... with glory and
                        honour" (Psalms 8: 4-5)</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>The scriptures speak the
                        truth. From them you can learn enough about all three acts to get your
                        bearings and get direction in your life. They reveal that, "Ye were
                        also in the
                        beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of
                        truth", and that "truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they
                        were, and as they are to come" (D&amp;C
                        9:23-24): Act I, Act II, and Act III.</big></font></big></p>

                        they were, as they actually are, not just as they appear to be, and you
                        can learn of things as they are to come. What happens to you after the
                        curtain comes down on this second act of mortal life, we take on faith.

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>I have studied this script,
                        the scriptures, even memorized parts of it. I'm sure you have. Let me
                        tell you in brief headlines what the scriptures say about this drama of
                        the
                        ages, "The Great Plan of Happiness."</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>The spirits of men and women
                        are eternal. All are sons and daughters of God and lived in a premortal
                        life as His spirit children. The spirit of each individual is in the
                        likeness
                        of the person in mortality are, male and female. All are in the image
                        of heavenly parents. </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>In the Council of the Gods
                        the plan of the Eternal Father (Alma 34:9) was sustained. It provided
                        for the creation of an earth (Abr. 3:24) whereupon His children would
                        receive physical bodies (see Abr. 4:26-27: Moses 6:3-10) and would be
                        tested according to His commandment. (Abr. 3:25). Each spirit in
                        premortal life was provided
                        opportunities for learning and obedience. Each was given agency (see
                        Alma 13:3-5). </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>A grand council in heaven was
                        conveyed. The divine plan required one to be sent as a Savior and
                        Redeemer to fulfill the plan of the Father. The firstborn of the
                        Eternal
                        Father, Jehovah, willingly volunteered and was chosen. </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Most sustained this choice.
                        Others rebelled and there was a "war in heaven." Satan and those who
                        followed him in rebellion against the Father's plan were cast out and
                        denied mortality (see: Rev. 12:7-13; Moses 4:3; D.&amp;C 29:36: 74:23).
                    </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Those who kept the first
                        estate (you are among them) were to be added upon with a physical body
                        and were permitted to live upon the earth in this planned second estate
                        (see: Abr. 3:26). Each was appointed the "times and the bounds of their
                        habitation'. Some were foreordained to be prophets (see: Abr. 3:23;
                        alma 13:7-9) </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>An earth was then organized
                        (Abr. 5:4). Adam and Eve in a paradisiacal state were the first man and
                        first woman. They were married eternally (Moses 3:23-24) and were
                        given commandments. They were in a state of innocence and knew no sin
                        (2 Nephi. 2:23). </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Eve, beguiled by Satan
                        transgressed and was to be cast out of the Garden. Adam chose to obey
                        the first commandment to multiply and replenish the earth. He with Eve
                        was subject to the Fall which introduced mortality to the earth Adam
                        and Eve became the first parents of the family of all the earth.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Angels were sent to reveal to
                        Adam the eternal plan of redemption and an atonement was wrought by
                        Jesus Christ. Through the atonement the effects of the Fall, mortal
                        death and spiritual death, could both be overcome. Christ
                        unconditionally provided a resurrection for all mankind and thereby
                        overcame physical death. </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>But to overcome spiritual
                        death, which is separation from God, requires that we be obedient to
                        the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>These principles and
                        ordinances were instituted before the foundation of the world. They are
                        not to be altered or changed. All must be saved by the same
                        requirements.
                        The priesthood administers the ordinances of salvation. The keys of the
                        priesthood control the use of the priesthood. </big></font></big></p>

                        introduced to the spirit world. It is happiness, a paradise, for the
                        righteous. It is misery for the wicked In either, we continue to learn
                        and are
                        accountable for our actions.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>After all have been dealt
                        with equally, a judgment will be rendered. Each will be resurrected in
                        his or her own order. The glory one receives, however, will depend on
                        obedience to the laws and ordinances of our Father's plan.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Those who have become pure,
                        through repentance, will obtain eternal life and return to the presence
                        of God. They will be exalted as heirs of God and joint heirs with
                        Christ
                        (D&amp;C 76:94-95; 84:35: 132:19-20: Romans 8:17). </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Provision is made in the plan
                        for those who live in mortality without knowing of the plan. "Where
                        there is no law given there is no punishment; and where there is no
                        punishment there is no condemnation; - -. because of the atonement; ...
                        they are delivered" </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Without that sacred work of
                        the redemption of the dead, the plan would be incomplete and would
                        really be unfair. The ordinances of the temple, the endowments, the
                        sealing in eternal marriage are worth all the preparation required. Do
                        not do anything which may make you unworthy to receive them or Act III
                        of this eternal drama will be
                        less than you are now free to make it.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>That is a brief overview of
                        this eternal drama as recorded in the scriptures. When you understand
                        it, it will give you purpose and direction in life. Then you will have
                        your feet
                        on straight and head on the ground. (I put that in to see if you are
                        paying attention and also to illustrate that there is humor and
                        enjoyment in life--they are a part of the
                        Plan!)</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>There is, of course, a
                        villain in all this, the adversary, the schemer, the destroyer. He got
                        off track in Act I. He has sworn to spoil the plan for everyone. And he
                        has legions of
                        angels, dark angels, to help him do it. He, too, has a plan called the
                        cunning plan (2 Nephi 9:22), a very subtle plan, a secret plan, the
                        plan of destruction.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>"He persuadeth no man to do
                        good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject
                        themselves unto him." </big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Now, here you are on stage in
                        Act II of this eternal drama, your own second estate.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>You live in the last days, a
                        dispensation of intense testing and unequalled opportunity. Paul, the
                        Apostle, wrote a remarkable prophecy to young Timothy. He said, "In the
                        last days, perilous times shall come". He described our day in accurate
                        detail.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>He wrote of men becoming
                        "lovers of their own selves" He spoke of disobedience to parents, of
                        "despisers of those that are good". He even saw those who "without
                        natural
                        affection" could abuse little children, and those who now rally in
                        protest for the abandonment of those standards without which
                        civilization will not endure.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Now when enough people
                        protest limits on conduct, the limits are moved farther out and
                        behavior that was once-prohibited is reclassified as moral, legal, and
                        socially
                        acceptable, and people rally and protest tomake it so. The bonds of
                        marriage and kinship are seen as bondage rather than as sacred ties.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>The home, the family,
                        absolutely critical to the Plan, are now besieged. And you are on stage
                        in the center of it all.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Just as the air you breathe
                        may expose you to deadly virus, the thoughts you think may introduce
                        spiritual diseases which, if untreated, may be spiritually fatal.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>But Paul's prophecy of the
                        perilous last days included an antidote, the immunization, which can
                        protect, even cure, you. After describing those who are "ever learning,
                        and
                        never able to come to a knowledge of the truth', he counseled, "But
                        continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been
                        assured of, knowing of whom thou
                        has learned them." Know who is teaching you.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>"And that from a child thou
                        hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto
                        salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>"All scripture is by
                        inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
                        correction, for instruction in righteousness.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>For example: First Nephi,
                        chapter eight, in the Book of Mormon, describes the great and spacious
                        building. Put those verses together with Second Timothy, chapter three,
                        from the New Testament, and you will see the world in which you live.
                        Read those scriptures thoughtfully.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>You will learn that the Plan
                        is fair; however it appears, it is fair. Alma told his son that the
                        commandments were not given until after the plan was revealed, saying:</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>"God gave unto them
                        commandments, <em>after </em>having made known unto them the plan of
                        redemption." (Alma 12:32). And listen carefully.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>The Prophet Joseph Smith
                        taught that "all beings who have bodies have cower over those who have
                        not. The devil has no power over us only as we permit him." Lest
                        unwittingly you give him such permission, let me alert you to ideas
                        floating around that are spiritually dangerous. For an example, take
                        the word "freedom."</big></font></big></p>

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big><strong>FREEDOM - AGENCY</strong></big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>A little twisting the word
                        freedom can lead to the loss of it. Individual freedom without
                        responsibility can destroy freedom. For example, right now there are
                        many who
                        indulge freely in that which the Lord has forbidden, and now, as a
                        result, following-compelled, I suppose--by physical impulses, they are
                        prisoners to an incurable disease
                        and they expose the innocent, as well.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>It is in the name of freedom
                        that terrorists now seek to destroy the institutions of society, which
                        were established to guarantee freedom. Read the first few verses of
                        Helaman, chapter 12, and you will learn why terror will yet be visited
                        upon mankind. Interesting to find that word <em>terror </em>in the
                        Book of Mormon.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>We often speak often of
                        agency as a divine right. The only agency spoken of in the revelations
                        is moral agency! This, the Lord said, is given "that every man may act
                        in
                        doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral
                        agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable
                        for his own sins in the day of
                        judgment" (D&amp;C 101:78). If you do not temper freedom with
                        responsibility and agency with accountability, they both will
                        self-destruct.</big></font></big></p>

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Another example: Diversity is
                        a very popular word which self-destructs if handled carelessly.
                        Properly respected, diversity is the friend to the word choice. But,
                        like freedom,
                        diversity can devour itself and choice will disappear.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Beware of those who teach a
                        diversity in which everybody, every philosophy, and all behavior must
                        be accepted everywhere with standards adjusted to accommodate and
                        to please everyone. They are really arguing for their own brand of
                        conformity.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>For example, if we change the
                        standards at Church schools, and there are some who really press for
                        that, so that we conform more to the world, we lose the very idea of an
                        education rooted in faith in the Restored Gospel. Then there will be no
                        choice, and diversity will have eaten itself up.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>The hidden trap connected
                        with diversity is that a misunderstanding of it can cause you to accept
                        what is and lose sight of what <u>ought to be</u>.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>We must and will maintain
                        high standards in the Church in the name of choice and diversity. We
                        have the right to create environments in our Church schools, in our
                        Institutes of Religion, and individually in our minds, in our homes, in
                        the Church at large to create a Zion.</big></font></big></p>

                        purpose is to open your mind to the secular and spiritual truths which

                        students with diseased ideas. The test depends on whether they are
                        teaching
                        about false standards or theories or philosophies or whether they are
                        advocates of them. You must discern whether you are being taught about

                        foolish

                        neighbor
                        children died, she learned to her horror that it was small pox, not

                        opposition to the standards set by the Lord and entrusted to His
                        servants, those who have established, who finance, and who are

                        in our environment is free to choose another, but they are not free to

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>An experience. At the end of
                        advanced flight training during World War U, it was customary for each
                        instructor pilot at our base to invite his cadets to a dinner the week
                        before graduation. Final decisions on graduation were yet to be made
                        and we were all very sensitive that it was by the word of our
                        instructor that we would get our
                        commission as an officer and those coveted silver wings.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Our instructor took us to a
                        noisy road house near the air base in Marfa, Texas. He said, "The
                        drinks are on me! Drink up and enjoy yourselves!" I managed to get by
                        on soft
                        drinks until the cadet sitting next to me blurted out, "Captain Goff,
                        do you know what Packer is doing?" I gave him a jab with my elbow and
                        whispered to him something that
                        had to do with his not living very long. And before long no one seemed
                        to be paying much attention to anything and I survived the challenge.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>I suppose I handled that as
                        best I could. Looking back on it, I think there would have been a much
                        better way. I could have, and I should have, told my instructor of my
                        convictions, that my faith prohibited me from drinking liquor. If I had
                        done so, surely I could have avoided that crisis.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>If your professor is
                        reasonable, you might tell him that your church encourages you to learn
                        about all things, but your faith gives you reasons for not accepting
                        every theory
                        or philosophy that anyone believes to be true.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Sometimes even that may not
                        be advisable. Just remember, you are not alone. You have the spirit of
                        inspiration to guide you in your studies, your tests, and in your
                        contacts in the world. Have courage and remember who you are and that
                        you are on stage in Act II of the great plan of redemption. You can
                        know by the Spirit those
                        teachers you can safely trust.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>A knowledge of the plan of
                        happiness can help you through the difficult times and you can face
                        problems you otherwise could not endure.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>For example: Some years ago a
                        president of a student stake asked if I would counsel with a young
                        couple. The stalwart young man and his lovely wife had recently been
                        told, with some finality, that they would never have children of their
                        own. They were heartbroken as they sobbed out their disappointment.
                        What they wanted most in life,
                        what they had been taught and knew was an obligation and a privilege
                        beyond price (part of the Plan), they now were to be denied. Why? Why?
                        Why?</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>I consoled them as best I
                        could and offered comfort that really was insufficient to quiet the
                        pain they felt. As they were leaving the office, I called them back and
                        said: "You
                        are a very fortunate and very blessed young couple."</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>They were startled and the
                        young man asked why would I say such a thing as that. Did I not
                        understand what they had told me? Why would I say they were fortunate
                        and
                        blessed, when they were to be denied the thing they wanted most,
                        children of their own.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>I answered, "Because you want
                        them. In the eternal scheme of things that will be of inestimable and
                        eternal value." The Lord has said that He "will judge all men according
                        to their works; according to the desires of their hearts" (D&amp;C
                        137:9). Many people now do not want children or want few of them or
                        consider them a burden rather than a
                        blessing." They were a very blessed young couple.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>When you understand the plan,
                        you can cope with challenges in life which otherwise would be
                        unbearable.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Now, when I speak of the law
                        and of rules, I always get a letter or two pointing out a variation or
                        an exception. There is an old saying that the exception proves the
                        rule.
                        That's a true statement.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>You be careful that you don't
                        look for exceptions as an excuse to avoid keeping the rules and don't
                        trust those who do. If something has to be labeled an exception, really
                        it
                        does prove the rule.</big></font></big></p>

                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Now, if you suppose some of
                        you because of mistakes you have already made, think that you have lost
                        your future. Let me in conclusion teach you this--one more
                        inoculation:</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>For a number of years I found
                        relaxation in carving and painting songbirds, at times spending a full
                        year on a single carving. That suggests how much time I had now and
                        again. Once I had a newly finished carving on the back seat of a car
                        driven by Elder A. Theodore Tuttle. He hit the brakes suddenly and the
                        carving was thrown to the floor
                        and damaged.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Elder Tuttle felt terrible,
                        supposing he had ruined a year's work. When I waved aside his
                        apologies, he said, "You sure don't seem to be upset about it." To
                        reassure him, I
                        said "Don't worry, I made it; I can fix it." Actually it had been
                        broken and fixed many times while I was working on it.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Later Brother Tuttle likened
                        that experience to lives, broken or badly damaged, supposedly ruined
                        with no hope of repair, not knowing that there is a Maker, a Creator,
                        who
                        can fix any of his creations no matter how hopelessly broken they seem
                        to be.</big></font></big></p>

                        that you as young members of the Church may look forward to a wonderful
                        life
                        of challenges and happiness and responsibility. It is a wonderful time
                        to live and to be young. I envy you. As I said in the beginning, you
                        are young and I am not. And yet in
                        the eternal scheme of things, I am just as young as you are. Maybe a
                        little closer to the final curtain on Act II, but I know, for I have
                        seen a little behind the curtain into Act III
                        and bear personal witness that the gospel is true, and bear witness of
                        Jesus Christ.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>In closing, I invoke a
                        blessing upon you, you young men and women who hopefully are looking
                        for a companion, you newly married men and women starting a family--
                        looking forward to the adventure in life, may the power of the Lord
                        watch over you and his Spirit attend you. The Holy Ghost will bless you
                        with a testimony.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>Fear is the antithesis of
                        faith. In this Church, we do not fear. I have been sitting in the
                        councils of the Brethren now for some thirty-four years or so. I have
                        seen
                        disappointment, shock, and concern. Never once, for one second, have I
                        ever seen any fear. And you should not.</big></font></big></p>
                <p><big><font face="Arial" size="-1"><big>May He bless you as you find
                        your way. I am sure He will and bear that witness to you and invoke
                        that blessing upon you in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br>
