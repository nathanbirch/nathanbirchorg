                    Dear Brothers and Sisters:
                    </big></big></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>All about
                    us we see evidence
                    of the
                    corrosive elements targeted to injure
                    our youth. We compliment most warmly those of our young people who
                    choose
                    to follow the way of the Lord and the program of the Church. We are
                    pleased
                    to note that faith is increasing among our youth, for which we are
                    deeply
                    grateful.
                    </big></big></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Unfortunately,
                    there are some
                    who
                    fall into the adversary's net and
                    drift into inactivity and trouble. We are deeply concerned with these.
                    </big></big></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>We call
                    upon parents to devote
                    their best efforts to the teaching and
                    rearing of their children in gospel principles which will keep them
                    close
                    to the Church. The home is the basis of a righteous life, and no other
                    instrumentality can take its place or fulfill its essential functions
                    in
                    carrying forward this God-given responsibility.
                    </big></big></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>We counsel
                    parents and
                    children to
                    give highest priority to family prayer,
                    family home evening, gospel study and instruction, and wholesome family
                    activities. However worthy and appropriate other demands or activities
                    may be, they must not be permitted to displace the divinely-appointed
                    duties
                    that only parents and families can adequately perform.
                    </big></big></p>
                    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big style="font-family: arial;"><big>We
                    urge bishops and other
                    Church
                    officers to do all they can to assist
                    parents in seeing that they have time and help, where needed, as they
                    nurture
                    their families and bring them up in the way of the Lord. Wherever
                    possible,
                    Sunday meetings, other than those under the three-hour schedule and
                    perhaps
                    council meetings on early Sunday mornings or fireside later in the
                    evening,
                    should be avoided so that parents may be with their children. As we
                    strengthen
                    families, we will strengthen the entire Church.
