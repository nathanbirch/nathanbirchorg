<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><big>Many years ago, large packs
of wolves roamed the countryside in Ukraine, making travel in that part
of the world very dangerous. These wolf packs were fearless. They were
not intimidated by people nor by any of the weapons available at that
time.
The only thing that seemed to frighten them was fire. Consequently,
travelers
who found themselves away from cities developed the common practice of
building a large bonfire and keeping it burning through the night. As
long
as the fire burned brightly, the wolves stayed away. But if it were
allowed
to burn out and die, the wolves would move in for an attack. Travelers
understood that building and maintaining a roaring bonfire was not just
a matter of convenience or comfort; it was a matter of survival. (See
Mary
Pratt Parrish,
<i>Ensign</i>, May 1972, p. 25.)</big></font></font>
</big></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><big>We do not have to protect
ourselves from wolf packs as we travel the road of life today, but, in
a spiritual sense, we do face the devious wolves of Satan in the forms
of temptation, evil, and sin. We live in dangerous times when these
ravenous
wolves roam the spiritual countryside in search of those who may be
weak
in faith or feeble in their conviction. In his first epistle, Peter
described
our "adversary the devil, as a roaring lion [that] walketh about,
seeking
whom he may devour." (1 Pet. 5:8.) The Lord told the Prophet Joseph
Smith
that "enemies prowl around thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb."
(D&amp;C 122:6.) We are all vulnerable to attack. However, we can
fortify
ourselves with the protection provided by a burning testimony that,
like
a bonfire, has been built adequately and maintained carefully.</big></font></font>
</big></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><big><u>Unfortunately, some in
the Church may believe sincerely that their testimony is a raging
bonfire
when it really is little more than the faint flickering of a candle</u>.
Their faithfulness has more to do with habit than holiness, and their
pursuit
of personal righteousness almost always takes a back seat to their
pursuit
of personal interests and pleasure. With such a feeble light of
testimony
for protection, these travelers on life's highways are easy prey for
the
wolves of the adversary. <small>("Spiritual Bonfires of Testimony,"

Savior's yoke upon us we "shall find rest unto [our] souls" (Matthew
11:29).
If we are only part-time soldiers, though, partially yoked, we
experience
quite the opposite: frustration, irritation, and the absence of His
full
grace and spiritual rest. In that case weaknesses persist and
satisfactions
are intermittent. . . Actually the partially yoked experience little
spiritual
satisfaction, because they are burdened by carrying the awful weight of
the natural man -- without any of the joys that come from progressing
toward
becoming "the man of Christ." They have scarcely "[begun] to be
enlightened"
(Alma 32:34). The meek and fully yoked, on the other hand, find God's
reassuring
grace and see their weakness yielding to strength (see Ether 12:27).</big></font></font>
</big></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><big>Strange as it seems, a few
of the partially yoked, undeservedly wearing the colors of the kingdom,
are just close enough to the prescribed path and process to be able to
observe in others some of the visible costs of discipleship. Sobered by
that observation, they want victory without battle and expect campaign
ribbons merely for watching; but there is no witness until after the
trial
of their faith (see Ether 12:6).</big></font></font>

know just enough about the doctrines to converse superficially on them,
but their scant knowledge about the deep doctrines is inadequate for
deep
discipleship</u> (see 1 Corinthians 2:10). <u>Thus uninformed about
the
deep doctrines, they make no deep change in their lives</u>. They lack
the faith to "give place" (Alma 32:27) consistently for real
discipleship.
Such members move out a few hundred yards from the entrance to the
straight
and narrow path and repose on the first little rise, thinking, "Well,
this
is all there is to it"; and they end up living far below their
possibilities.
While not as distant as those King Benjamin described "For how knoweth
a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto
him,
and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?" (Mosiah 5:13)

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><big>Events and circumstances
in the last days make it imperative for us as members of the Church to
become more grounded, rooted, established, and settled (see Col. 1:23;
Col. 2:7; 2 Pet. 1:12). Jesus said to His disciples, "settle this in
your
hearts, that ye will do the things which I shall teach, and command
you"
(JST Luke 14:28). If not so settled, the turbulence will be severe. If
settled, we will not be "tossed to and fro," whether by rumors, false
doctrines,
or by the behavioral and intellectual fashions of the world. Nor will
we
get caught up in the "talk show" mentality, spending our time like
ancient
Athenians "in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new
thing"
(Acts 17:21). Why be concerned with the passing preferences of the
world
anyway? "For the fashion of this world passeth away" (1 Cor. 7:31). . .

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><big><u>Some try to get by with
