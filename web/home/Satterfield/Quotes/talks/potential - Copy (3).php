                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>I am always pleased to hear
                        brother Joseph Young speak, because, as the Indian says, "he talks good
                        talk;" and I always like to hear people talk good talk, and things that
                        are calculated to make one feel pleasant and comfortable.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>A passage of Scripture which
                        he quoted attracted my attention. It is one of the sayings of David--"What
                        is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest
                        him?"</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>In one point of view, man
                        appears very poor, weak, and imbecile, and very insignificant: in another
                        point of view, he appears wise, intelligent, strong, honourable, and exalted.
                        It is just in the way that you look at a man that you are led to form your
                        opinions concerning him. In one respect, he appears as is were, as the
                        grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven.
                        He is changeable in his opinions, in his thoughts, reflections, and actions.
                        He is idle, vain, and visionary, without being governed by any correct
                        principle. He comes into existence, as it were, like a butterfly, flutters
                        around for a little while, dies, and is no more. In another point of view,
                        we look at him as emanating from the Gods--as a God in embryo--as an eternal
                        being who had an existence before he came here, and who will exist after
                        his mortal remains are mingled and associated with dust, from whence he
                        came, and from whence he will be resurrected and partake of that happiness
                        for which he is destined, or receive the reward of his evil deeds, according
                        to circumstances.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>If we look at the position
                        of man as he has been and as he is, what is he, whether we regard the most
                        powerful and mighty, or the most humble,--whether as emperors, warriors,
                        statesmen, philosophers, as rich or poor, we find he has passed away, and
                        to us is sleeping in oblivion. Where are some of those great and mighty
                        men that made the earth tremble--at whose nod and beck, and at the crook
                        of whose finger nations quaked with fear? They have returned to dust, and
                        ashes and worms prey upon their systems. They have wanted away, and many
                        of the great and honourable are as much despised since they died as they
                        were honoured while they lived and were in the possession of their earthly
                        glory. What is man?</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>In some points of view,
                        the human race are feeble indeed. They are feeble in their bodies, minds,
                        and spirits, and need some sustaining influence to uphold them both in
                        body and mind before they can occupy their true position in society, whether
                        in relation to this world, or in relation to the world which is to come.
                        For instance, a man may study for years, and perhaps some faint affliction
                        of his body will overturn his intellect; he loses his senses, his reason
                        is fled, and he becomes a raving maniac. We are indeed poor creatures.
                        Think what a number of infirmities the human system is subject to, until
                        finally death closes its mortal career, and it is laid among the silent
                        dead.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>Let us ask what the nations
                        of the earth have accomplished for the last six or seven thousand years.
                        What great work have they achieved? What have the greatest warriors and
                        statesmen that have existed from the beginning done? What good have they
                        accomplished for the world? What boon have they handed down to posterity,
                        and how much better are we off because they lived, because they moved upon
                        the earth, and because they possessed a certain power upon it? They have
                        accomplished a solemn nothing. Where are those mighty conquerors and bright
                        geniuses now? Where are some of the mightiest men? and what has become
                        of the nations and cities where they flourished? It has become a matter
                        of doubt where even the foundations of Babylon and Nineveh were laid. Egypt,
                        it is true, has preserved some of its ancient monuments, kings, and princes
                        unto the present day. What are those men? Loathsome mummies. What are they
                        doing with them? The great Potiphars, Ptolemies, and Pharaohs are now being
                        used for fuel to make steam to drive railway cars.</font></span><font size=-1></font>

                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>What is man, surely, when
                        we look at him in this point of view? And what are those ancient nations?
                        What intelligence have they communicated to the men of future ages? What
                        real good have they done them?</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>A great many of the ancients
                        nations were idolators. They worshipped dogs, cats, crocodiles, serpents,
                        and every kind of thing that came within the range of their imagination.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>They could not get any idea
                        of the true God, any more than they Christian world can at the present
                        time, without revelation, nor any knowledge of the reason of their being
                        on the earth, what they came into the world for, and what they were designed
                        to accomplish. If we look at the world in this point of view, it presents
                        a sorry spectacle.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>We talk sometimes about
                        the great works of artists, painters, sculptors, &amp;c.. But what have
                        those smart geniuses accomplished of real practical good to the world?
                        What do their records show? Their works may be seen in many of the capitals
                        of the nations of Europe. What are they? So many representations of war,
                        destruction, and death. If you examine some of the galleries of art in
                        France, the history of that country can be traced from the third century
                        to the present time. You find in those galleries splendid specimens of
                        art; and what are they? Here is a representation of a battle fought; there,
                        the representation of death and destruction; and yonder is a splendid picture
                        representing the march of a victorious army, destroying an unfortunate
                        and vanquished people, and treading down the dead and dying. The history
                        of those nations is marked in blood and tears.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>How much better is the world
                        now, in any point of view, than in former days? What blessings have the
                        great men of former ages handed down to posterity? Were they all collected,
                        they would appear in little room. It is true there has been some little
                        knowledge of chemistry and astronomy developed. And I question very much
                        whether the people now know more about astronomy than Abraham and Joseph
                        of old did, after all their problems and calculations, and all the intelligence
                        of the schools in relation to this branch of science.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>It is true we have obtained
                        a little knowledge of the power of steam and electricity, and have been
                        able to use magnetism and many other such principle which possess some
                        utility at the present time to the human family. But how much better off
                        is the world of mankind now than they were four or five thousand years
                        ago? I do not know. If anybody else does, I should like them to tell me.
                        Tell me how much more union there is now than then, how much more happiness
                        there is now than formerly, how much more conversant the world is now with
                        correct principles than the world was in what is called the dark ages,
                        and how much better principles they are governed by than they were thousands
                        of years ago. They then had their republics, their monarchies, and their
                        despotisms. There is as much of the spirit of war in existence now as in
                        any previous age of the world.</font></span><font size=-1></font>

                        and with all the essays there have been written, combined with all the
                        influence of the Priesthood of the present day? Men are paid in our age
                        for doing a great deal, and they ought to accomplish, at least something.
                        As I told a Catholic priest once in France, when speaking of the position
                        of France--I said, "There are some fifty thousand Catholic priests in France:
                        and if Catholicism does not produce an influence in this nation, it ought
                        to; for there is enough money paid to sustain men to do good among the

                        and thought and being last, or immortality endures." What is he? He had
                        his being in the eternal worlds; he existed before he came here. He is
                        not only the Son of man, but he is the Son of God also. He is a God in
                        embryo, and possesses within him a spark of that eternal flame which was
                        struck from the blaze of God's eternal fire in the eternal world, and is
                        placed here upon the earth that he may possess true intelligence, true
                        light, true knowledge,--that he may know himself-- that he may know God--that
                        he may know something about what he was before he came here--that he may
                        know something about what he is destined to enjoy in the eternal worlds--that
                        he may be fully acquainted with his origin, with his present existence,
                        and with his future destiny,--that he may know something about the strength
                        and weakness of human nature--that he may understand the Divine law, and
                        learn to conquer his passions, and bring into subjection every principle
                        that is at variance with the law of God,--that he may understand his true
                        relationship to God; and finally, that he may learn how to subdue, to conquer,
                        subject all wrong, seek after, obtain, and possess every true, holy, virtuous,
                        and heavenly principle; and as he is only a sojourner, that he may fulfil
                        the measure of his creation, help himself and family, be a benefit to the
                        present and future generations, and go back to God, having accomplished
                        the work he came here to perform.</font></span><font size=-1></font>

                        from God. Those Prophets, when wrapped in prophetic vision--when their

                        of future ages, and contemplated a time when iniquity should no longer

                        to the kingdom of God, which should be established in the latter day, and
                        the government of God be maintained, and his holy Priesthood hold universal

                        minds lit up from time to time. They got simply a glimpse of the things
                        that it is our privilege as a people to enjoy.</font></span><font size=-1></font>
                <p><span STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><font size=-1>God has gathered us from
                        among all the nations of the earth. He has called us together by the light
                        of his truth--by the light of his Spirit--by the light of his Gospel of
                        peace. He has gathered us together into one fold; he has given us revelation;
                        he has given us a knowledge of ourselves, and a slight knowledge of himself,
                        so far as we have lived up to our privileges, and so far as we have cultivated
                        the light of the Spirit he has given to us. He has given us a knowledge
                        of our weakness and of our strength and of our imperfections. We are permitted
                        to derive from God all the powers of the Priesthood. The light of truth
                        has been developed, and many things pertaining to the future.</font></span><font size=-1></font>

                        he will lead us on from light to light, from truth to truth, from intelligence
                        to intelligence, until we shall know and see and comprehend God, whom to
                        know is life everlasting. He has planted within us, through the principles
                        of eternal truth, the germs of everlasting life; so that Death, which has
                        been a terror to all nations for generations past, which has caused men
                        to quail, and through which the Jews all their life long were subject to
                        bondage, has lost its terrors on the minds of men who live their religion,
                        who walk according to the laws of the holy Priesthood, and cultivate the
                        Spirit of God. That grim messenger has lost his formidable appearance,
                        and people feel easy and comfortable under any circumstances; that is,
                        those who do right, fear god, work righteousness, and keep his commandments.
                        They know they have within them that principle of eternal life which shall
                        live after this mortal tabernacle shall crumble in the dust.</font></span><font size=-1></font>

                        all right; if it is health; it is all right; for it is all eternal life

                        thing he came into existence for. We have come here to build up the kingdom
                        of God, to establish correct principles, to teach the world righteousness,
                        and to make millions of the human family happy--even all who will listen
                        to the principles of eternal truth. We are here to introduce correct doctrine,
                        to introduce correct morals, to introduce correct philosophy, to introduce
                        correct government, and to teach men how to live and how to die--how to
                        be happy in this world and in the world which is to come, and to lay the
                        foundation for eternal lives in the eternal worlds.</font></span><font size=-1></font>

                        governed by virtuous principles, possessing elevated ideas, wishing to
                        realize everything that God has destined to submit to all his laws, to
                        endure every kind of privation and affliction and suffering, as seeing
                        Him that is invisible, looking for a city that hath foundations, whose

                        and go on with that eternal progression, not only in this world, but in

                        their inhabitants? No. Do we expect to have our name perpetuated by being
                        embalmed and laid by, as the Egyptians were after they died? No. Do we
                        expect to perpetuate fame by building cities and monuments? No. What then?
                        We expect to perpetuate our fame and our name by living propagating correct
                        principles--by the establishment of correct laws--by the building up of
                        the kingdom of God--by imbibing and receiving light and intelligence from
                        the living God--by living in the enjoyment of all the blessings that God
                        has in reserve for his Saints--by driving back the dark cloud of error
                        and superstitions that has overspread the moral horizon of the world--by
                        establishing a nucleus of truth, intelligence, light, morality, philosophy,
                        religion, government, and everything else that is calculated to promote
                        and exalt the human family in time and in all eternity; and then, like
                        some of the ancient patriarchs--like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and many
                        of the ancient Saints, enter into the New Jerusalem, and there live with
                        our posterity, our friends, and relations; and then pass on by the eternal
                        laws of progression to associate with the Gods, worlds without end, in
                        all intelligence and perfection, and in promoting the happiness of all
                        beings pertaining to this world and the world that is to come. There is
                        something of man when you look at him in a proper point of view.</font></span><font size=-1></font>

                        us very much. Some of us are learning to cheat and defraud our neighbors,
                        and some are learning to steal. There is nothing smart about all this.
                        A negro, a Hottentot, or an Indian can do that. There is nothing in these
                        practices that bespeaks an intelligent mind, or that would recommend a
