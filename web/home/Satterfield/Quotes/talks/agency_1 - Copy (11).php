                            may be tired of others trying to run your life-always telling you what
                            to do. After all, you have the right to make your own choices. That is
                            correct. You have that right. It is your agency. The secret to solve
                            problems in your life will be found in understanding and using the
                            eternally beneficial interaction of your agency and His truth.</big></span><br>

                            The Master said: "He that keepeth [the] commandments receiveth truth
                            and light. &#8230;</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

                            &#8220;And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through
                            disobedience, from the children of men.&#8221; (D&amp;C 93:28, 37, 39;
                            emphasis added.)</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            He also declared, "Every man may act in doctrine and principle, &#8230;
                            according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every
                            man may be accountable &#8230; in the day of judgment" (D&amp;C 101:78;

                            These scriptures teach how to overcome the effects of wrong choices,
                            whether they be lying, stealing, gambling, addiction to alcohol or
                            drugs, immorality, inflicting abuse, or anything like it. Simply
                            stated, one must use his agency to obey truth. <small>(&#8220;Healing Your

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><big>If,
                            through our unrighteous choices, we have lost our footing on that path,
                            we must remember the agency we were given, agency we may choose to
                            exercise again. I speak especially to those overcome by the thick
                            darkness of addiction. If you have fallen into destructive, addictive
                            behaviors, you may feel that you are spiritually in a black hole. As
                            with the real black holes in space, it may seem all but impossible for
                            light to penetrate to where you are. How do you escape? I testify the
                            only way is through the very agency you exercised so valiantly in your
                            premortal life, the agency that the adversary cannot take away without
                            your yielding it to him.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            How do you reclaim that agency? How do you begin again to exercise it
                            in the right way? You choose to act in faith and obedience. May I
                            suggest a few basic choices that you can begin to make now&#8211;this very
                            day.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Choose to accept&#8211;truly accept&#8211;that you are a child of God, that He
                            loves you, and that He has the power to help you.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Choose to put everything&#8211;literally everything&#8211;on the altar before Him.
                            Believing that you are His child, decide that your life belongs to Him
                            and that you will use your agency to do His will. You may do this
                            multiple times in your life, but never, never give up.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Choose to put yourself in a position to have experiences with the
                            Spirit of God through prayer, in scripture study, at Church meetings,
                            in your home, and through wholesome interactions with others. When you
                            feel the influence of the Spirit, you are beginning to be cleansed and
                            strengthened. The light is being turned on, and where that light
                            shines, the darkness of evil cannot remain.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Choose to obey and keep your covenants, beginning with your baptismal
                            covenant. Renew these covenants weekly by worthily partaking of the
                            sacrament.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Choose to prepare to worthily attend the temple, make and renew sacred
                            covenants, and receive all of the saving ordinances and blessings of
                            the gospel.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Finally, and most importantly, choose to believe in the Atonement of
                            Jesus Christ. Accept the Savior&#8217;s forgiveness, and then forgive
                            yourself. Because of His sacrifice for you, He has the power to
                            &#8220;remember [your sins] no more.&#8221; [D&amp;C 58:42] You must do likewise.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            After you are on the path and are &#8220;free to choose&#8221; again, choose to
                            reject feelings of shame for sins you have already repented of, refuse
                            to be discouraged about the past, and rejoice in hope for the future.
                            Remember, it is Satan who desires that we be &#8220;miserable like unto
                            himself.&#8221; [2 Ne. 2:27] Let your desires be stronger than his. Be happy
                            and confident about your life and about the opportunities and blessings
                            that await you here and throughout eternity.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Finally, remember our agency is not only for us. We have the
                            responsibility to use it in behalf of others, to lift and strengthen
                            others in their trials and tribulations. Some of our brothers and
                            sisters have lost the full use of their agency through unrighteous
                            choices. Without exposing ourselves to temptation, we can and should
                            invite others to receive the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
                            Through friendship and love, we may lead them along the path of
                            obedience and encourage them to use their agency to make the right
                            choices once again.</big></span><br>
                    <span style="font-family: arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            As Father Lehi testified to his family of the blessings of agency, I
                            also desire to testify to you, my beloved brothers and sisters
                            throughout the world and to my family. Agency was manifested in the
                            Council in Heaven as we chose to follow our Heavenly Father&#8217;s plan and
                            come to mortality for this probationary period. Agency allows us to be
                            tested and tried to see whether or not we will endure to the end and
                            return to our Heavenly Father with honor. Agency is the catalyst that
                            leads us to express our inward spiritual desires in outward Christlike
                            behavior. Agency permits us to make faithful, obedient choices that
                            strengthen us so that we can lift and strengthen others. Agency used
                            righteously allows light to dispel the darkness and enables us to live
                            with joy and happiness in the present, look with faith to the future,
                            even into the eternities, and not dwell on the things of the past. Our
                            use of agency determines who we are and what we will be. <small>(&#8220;To
