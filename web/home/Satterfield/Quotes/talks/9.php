<br>Lake City, Utah; Improvement Era 19:934-942, August, 1916; Liahona,
<br>the Elders' Journal 21:380-384, March 25, 1924; Jesus the Christ,
<br>Twelfth edition, February 1, 1924, pp. 465-473.</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scriptures plainly and
repeatedly affirm that God is the Creator of the earth and the heavens
and all things that in them are. In the sense so expressed the Creator
is an Organizer. God created the earth as an organized sphere; but He certainly
did not create, in the sense of bringing into primal existence, the ultimate
elements of the materials of which the earth consists, for "the elements
are eternal" (Doc. &amp; Cov. 93:33).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So also life is eternal,
and not created; but life, or the vital force, may be infused into organized
matter, though the details of the process have not been revealed unto man.
For illustrative instances see Genesis 2:7; Moses 3:7; and Abraham 5:7.
Each of these scriptures states that God breathed into the body of man
the breath of life. See further Moses 3:19, for the statement that God
breathed the breath of life into the bodies of the beasts and birds. God
showed unto Abraham "the intelligences that were organized before the world
was"; and by "intelligences" we are to understand personal "spirits" (Abraham
3:22, 23); nevertheless, we are expressly told that "Intelligence" that
is, "the light of truth was not created or made, neither indeed can be"
(Doc. &amp; Cov. 93:29).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term "Father" as applied
to Deity occurs in sacred writ with plainly different meanings. Each of
the four significations specified in the following treatment should be
carefully segregated.
<p><b>1. "Father" as Literal Parent</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scriptures embodying the
ordinary signification -- literally that of Parent -- are too numerous
and specific to require citation. The purport of these scriptures is to
the effect that God the Eternal Father, whom we designate by the exalted
name-title "Elohim," is the literal Parent of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, and of the spirits of the human race. Elohim is the Father in every
sense in which Jesus Christ is so designated, and distinctively He is the
Father of spirits. Thus we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews: "Furthermore
we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence;
shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and
live?" (Hebrews 12:9). In view of this fact we are taught by Jesus Christ
to pray: "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus Christ applies to
Himself both titles, "Son" and "Father." Indeed, He specifically said to
the brother of Jared: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the
Son" (Ether 3:14). Jesus Christ is the Son of Elohim both as spiritual
and bodily offspring; that is to say, Elohim is literally the Father of
the spirit of Jesus Christ and also of the body in which Jesus Christ performed
His mission in the flesh, and which body died on the cross and was afterward
taken up by the process of resurrection, and is now the immortalized tabernacle
of the eternal spirit of our Lord and Savior. No extended explanation of
the title "Son of God" as applied to Jesus Christ appears necessary.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>2. "Father" as Creator</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second scriptural meaning
of "Father" is that of Creator, e. g. in passages referring to any one
of the Godhead as "The Father of the heavens and of the earth and all things
that in them are" (Ether 4:7; see also Alma 11:38, 39 and Mosiah 15:4).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God is not the Father of
the earth as one of the worlds in space, nor of the heavenly bodies in
whole or in part, nor of the inanimate objects and the plants and the animals
upon the earth, in the literal sense in which He is the Father of the spirits
of mankind. Therefore, scriptures that refer to God in any way as the Father
of the heavens and the earth are to be understood as signifying that God
is the Maker, the Organizer, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this meaning, as the
context shows in every case, Jehovah, who is Jesus Christ the Son of Elohim,
is called "the Father," and even "the very eternal Father of heaven and
of earth" (see passages before cited, and also Mosiah 16:15). With analogous
meaning Jesus Christ is called "The Everlasting Father" (Isaiah 9:6; compare
2 Nephi 19:6). The descriptive titles "Everlasting" and "Eternal" in the
foregoing texts are synonymous.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That Jesus Christ, whom
we also know as Jehovah, was the executive of the Father, Elohim, in the
work of creation is set forth in the book "Jesus the Christ" Chapter 4.
Jesus Christ, being the Creator, is consistently called the Father of heaven
and earth in the sense explained above; and since His creations are of
eternal quality He is very properly called the Eternal Father of heaven
and earth.
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>3. Jesus Christ the "Father" of Those Who Abide in His Gospel</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third sense in which Jesus
Christ is regarded as the "Father" has reference to the relationship between
Him and those who accept His Gospel and thereby become heirs of eternal
life. Following are a few of the scriptures illustrating this meaning.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fervent prayer offered
just prior to His entrance into Gethsemane, Jesus Christ supplicated His
Father in behalf of those whom the Father had given unto Him, specifically
the apostles, and, more generally, all who would accept and abide in the
Gospel through the ministry of the apostles. Read in our Lord's own words
the solemn affirmation that those for whom He particularly prayed were
His own, and that His Father had given them unto Him: "I have manifested
thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they
were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. Now they have
known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. For I
have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received
them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed
that thou didst send me. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but
for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are
thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. And now I am no
more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy
Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that
they may be one as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them
in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is
lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled"
(John 17:6-12).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And further: "Neither pray
I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through
their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I
in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that
thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them;
that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that
they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. Father, I will
that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they
may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before
the foundation of the world" (John 17:20-24).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To His faithful servants
in the present dispensation the Lord has said: "Fear not, little children;
for you are mine, and I have overcome the world, and you are of them that
my Father hath given me" (Doc. &amp; Cov. 50:41).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salvation is attainable
only through compliance with the laws and ordinances of the Gospel; and
all who are thus saved become sons and daughters unto God in a distinctive
sense. In a revelation given through Joseph the Prophet to Emma Smith the
Lord Jesus addressed the woman as "My daughter," and said: "for verily
I say unto you, all those who receive my gospel are sons and daughters
in my kingdom" (Doc. &amp; Cov. 25:1). In many instances the Lord has addressed
men as His sons (e. g. Doc. &amp; Cov. 9:1; 34:3; 121:7).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That by obedience to the
Gospel men may become sons of God, both as sons of Jesus Christ, and, through
Him, as sons of His Father, is set forth in many revelations given in the
current dispensation. Thus we read in an utterance of the Lord Jesus Christ
to Hyrum Smith in 1829: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am
the life and the light of the world. I am the same who came unto my own
and my own received me not; But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as
many as receive me, to them will I give power to become the sons of God,
even to them that believe on my name. Amen." (Doc. &amp; Cov. 11:28-30).
To Orson Pratt the Lord spoke through Joseph the Seer, in 1830: "My son
Orson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto
you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer; The light and the life of the world;
a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;
Who so loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would
believe might come the sons of God: wherefore you are my son" (Doc. &amp;
Cov. 34:1-3). In 1830 the Lord thus addressed Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon:
"Listen to the voice of the Lord your God, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the end, whose course is one eternal round, the same today as yesterday,
and for ever. I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was crucified for
the sins of the world, even as many as will believe on my name, that they
may become the sons of God, even one in me as I am in the Father, as the
Father is one in me, that we may be one" (Doc. &amp; Cov. 35:1-2). Consider
also the following given in 1831: "Hearken and listen to the voice of him
who is from all eternity to all eternity, the Great I AM, even Jesus Christ,
The light and the life of the world; a light which shineth in darkness
and the darkness comprehendeth it not: The same which came in the meridian
of time unto my own, and my own received me not; But to as many as received
me, gave I power to become my sons, and even so will I give unto as many
as will receive me, power to become my sons" (Doc. &amp; Cov. 39:1-4).
In a revelation given through Joseph Smith in March, 1831 we read: "For
verily I say unto you that I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
end, the light and the life of the world -- a light that shineth in darkness
and the darkness comprehendeth it not. I came unto my own, and my own received
me not; but unto as many as received me, gave I power to do many miracles,
and to become the sons of God, and even unto them that believed on my name
gave I power to obtain eternal life" (Doc. &amp; Cov. 45:7-8).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A forceful exposition of
this relationship between Jesus Christ as the Father and those who comply
with the requirements of the Gospel as His children was given by Abinadi,
centuries before our Lord's birth in the flesh: "And now I say unto you.
Who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his
soul has been made an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. And now
what say ye? And who shall be his seed? Behold I say unto you, that whosoever
has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have
prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord; I say unto you, that all
those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would
redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission
of their sins; I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the
heirs of the kingdom of God: For these are they whose sins he has borne;
these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions.
And now, are they not his seed? Yea, and are not the prophets, every one
that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression;
I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you
that they are his seed" (Mosiah 15:10-13).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tragic contrast with
the blessed state of those who become children of God through obedience
to the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that of the unregenerate, who are specifically
called the children of the devil. Note the words of Christ, while in the
flesh, to certain wicked Jews who boasted of their Abrahamic lineage: "If
ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye do the deeds of your
father. If God were your Father, ye would love me. Ye are of your father
the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do" (John 8:39, 41, 42,
44). Thus Satan is designated as the father of the wicked, though we cannot
assume any personal relationship of parent and children as existing between
him and them. A combined illustration showing that the righteous are the
children of God and the wicked the children of the devil appears in the
parable of the Tares: "The good seed are the children of the kingdom; but
the tares are the children of the wicked one" (Matt. 13:38).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men may become children
of Jesus Christ by being born anew -- born of God, as the inspired word
states: "He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that
he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is born of God doth
not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because
he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children
of the devil: Whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither
he that loveth not his brother" (I John 3:8-10).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have been born
unto God through obedience to the Gospel may by valiant devotion to righteousness
obtain exaltation and even reach the status of Godhood. Of such we read:
"Wherefore, as it is written, they are Gods, even the sons of God" (Doc.
&amp; Cov. 76:58; compare 132:20, and contrast paragraph 17 in same section;
see also paragraph 37). Yet, though they be Gods they are still subject
to Jesus Christ as their Father in this exalted relationship; and so we
read in the paragraph following the above quotation: "and they are Christ's
and Christ is God's" (76:59).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the new birth -- that
of water and the Spirit -- mankind may become children of Jesus Christ,
being through the means by Him provided "begotten sons and daughters unto
God" (Doc. &amp; Cov. 76:2). This solemn truth is further emphasized in
the words of the Lord Jesus Christ given through Joseph Smith in 1833:
"And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father,
and am the firstborn; And all those who are begotten through me are partakers
of the glory of the same, and are the church of the firstborn" (Doc. &amp;
Cov. 93:21, 22). For such figurative use of the term "begotten" in application
to those who are born unto God see Paul's explanation: "for in Christ Jesus
I have begotten you through the gospel" (I Cor. 4:15). An analogous instance
of sonship attained by righteous service is found in the revelation relating
to the order and functions of Priesthood, given in 1832: "For whoso is
faithful unto the obtaining these two Priesthoods of which I have spoken,
and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the
renewing of their bodies: They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and
the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God"
(Doc. &amp; Cov. 84:33, 34).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it be proper to speak
of those who accept and abide in the Gospel as Christ's sons and daughters
-- and upon this matter the scriptures are explicit and cannot be gainsaid
nor denied -- it -- is consistently proper to speak of Jesus Christ as
the Father of the righteous, they having become His children and He having
been made their Father through the second birth -- the baptismal regeneration.
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>4. Jesus Christ the "Father" By Divine Investiture of Authority</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fourth reason for applying
the title "Father" to Jesus Christ is found in the fact that in all His
dealings with the human family Jesus the Son has represented and yet represents
Elohim His Father in power and authority. This is true of Christ in His
preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied state, in the which He was known
as Jehovah; also during His embodiment in the flesh; and during His labors
as a disembodied spirit in the realm of the dead; and since that period
in His resurrected state. To the Jews He said: "I and my Father are one"
(John 10:30; see also 17:11, 22); yet He declared "My Father is greater
than I" (John 14:28); and further, "I am come in my Father's name" (John
5:43; see also 10:25). The same truth was declared by Christ Himself to
the Nephites (see 3 Nephi 20:35 and 28:10), and has been reaffirmed by
revelation in the present dispensation (Doc. &amp; Gov. 50:43). Thus the
Father placed His name upon the Son; and Jesus Christ spoke and ministered
in and through the Father's name; and so far as power, authority and Godship
are concerned His words and acts were and are those of the Father.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We read, by way of analogy,
that God placed His name upon or in the Angel who was assigned to special
ministry unto the people of Israel during the exodus. Of that Angel the
Lord said: "Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him" (Exodus 23:21).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient apostle, John,
was visited by an angel who ministered and spoke in the name of Jesus Christ.
As we read: "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent
and signified it by his angel unto his servant John" (Revelation 1:1).
John was about to worship the angelic being who spoke in the name of the
Lord Jesus Christ, but was forbidden: "And I John saw these things, and
heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before
the feet of the angel which showed me these things. Then saith he unto
me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren
the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship
God" (Rev. 22:8, 9). And then the angel continued to speak as though he
were the Lord Himself: "And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with
me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the end, the first and the last" (verses 12, 13). The
resurrected Lord, Jesus Christ, who had been exalted to the right hand
of God His Father, had placed His name upon the angel sent to John, and
the angel spoke in the first person, saying "I come quickly," "I am Alpha
and Omega," though he meant that Jesus Christ would come, and that Jesus
Christ was Alpha and Omega.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None of these considerations,
however, can change in the least degree the solemn fact of the literal
relationship of Father and Son between Elohim and Jesus Christ. Among the
spirit children of Elohim the firstborn was and is Jehovah or Jesus Christ
to whom all others are juniors. Following are affirmative scriptures bearing
upon this great truth. Paul, writing to the Colossians, says of Jesus Christ:
"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in
earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him:
And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the
head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from
the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased
the Father that in him should all fullness dwell" (Colossians 1:15-19).
From this scripture we learn that Jesus Christ was "the firstborn of every
creature" and it is evident that the seniority here expressed must be with
respect to antemortal existence, for Christ was not the senior of all mortals
in the flesh. He is further designated as "the firstborn from the dead"
this having reference to Him as the first to be resurrected from the dead,
or as elsewhere written "the first fruits of them that slept" (I Corinthians
15:20, see also verse 23); and "the first begotten of the dead" (Revelation
1:5; compare Acts 26:23). The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews affirms
the status of Jesus Christ as the firstborn of the spirit children of His
Father, and extols the preeminence of the Christ when tabernacled in flesh:
"And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith,
And let all the angels of God worship him" (Hebrews 1:6; read the preceding
verses). That the spirits who were juniors to Christ were predestined to
be born in the image of their Elder Brother is thus attested by Paul: "And
we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to
them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow,
he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that
he might be the firstborn among many brethren" (Romans 8:28, 29). John
the Revelator was commanded to write to the head of the Laodicean church,
as the words of the Lord Jesus Christ: "These things saith the Amen, the
faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God" (Revelation
3:14). In the course of a revelation given through Joseph Smith in May,
1833, the Lord Jesus Christ said as before cited: "And now, verily I say
unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the firstborn"
(Doc. &amp; Cov. 93:21). A later verse makes plain the fact that human
beings generally were similarly existent in spirit state prior to their
embodiment in the flesh: "Ye were also in the beginning with the Father;
that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth" (verse 23).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no impropriety,
therefore, in speaking of Jesus Christ as the Elder Brother of the rest
of human kind. That He is by spiritual birth Brother to the rest of us
is indicated in Hebrews: "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be
made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins
of the people" (Hebrews 2:17). Let it not be forgotten, however, that He
is essentially greater than any and all others, by reason (1) of His seniority
as the oldest or firstborn; (2) of His unique status in the flesh as the
offspring of a mortal mother and of an immortal, or resurrected and glorified,
Father; (3) of His selection and foreordination as the one and only Redeemer
and Savior of the race; and (4) of His transcendent sinlessness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus Christ is not the
Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this
earth, for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons or daughters
of Elohim. So far as the stages of eternal progression and attainment have
been made known through divine revelation, we are to understand that only
resurrected and glorified beings can become parents of spirit offspring.
Only such exalted souls have reached maturity in the appointed course of
eternal life; and the spirits born to them in the eternal worlds will pass
in due sequence through the several stages or estates by which the glorified
parents have attained exaltation.
