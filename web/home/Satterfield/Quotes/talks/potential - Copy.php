                                become. Perhaps
                                there is something else that we will learn as we perfect our bodies and
                                our spirits in the times to come. You and I -- what helpless creatures
                                are we! Such limited power we have, and how little can we control the
                                wind
                                and the waves and the storms! We remember the numerous scriptures
                                which,
                                concentrated in a single line, were stated by a former prophet, Lorenzo
                                Snow: "As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may be." This is
                                a power available to us as we reach perfection and receive the
                                experience
                                and power to create, to organize, to control native elements. How
                                limited
                                we are now! We have no power to force the grass to grow, the plants to
                                emerge, the seeds to develop. (</span><i style="font-family: arial;">The
