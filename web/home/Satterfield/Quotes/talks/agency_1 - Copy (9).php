                            and surprise at the ease with which he controlled the people, and said
                            it was something that was not to be found among the learned men of the

                            am convinced that of all governments the greatest and the best is that
                            government in which the people govern themselves. The Prophet Joseph
                            Smith was asked by a stranger visitor at Nauvoo, &#8220;How do you govern
                            these people, these Americans, these Britons, these Scandinavians,
                            these men from all parts of the world, all nationalities, speaking
                            different languages, having different customs and traditions,&#8211;how do
                            you govern them, that they live together in peace, with a common
                            purpose, and in the spirit of unity?&#8221; The Prophet sagely answered--and
                            he never said a wiser thing--&#8220;I teach them correct principles, and they
                            govern themselves.&#8221; That government in which the people can and do
                            govern themselves by obedience to correct principles, is manifestly
                            superior to any government that depends upon one man&#8217;s will. The word
                            of God declares, &#8220;It is a slothful servant who waits to be commanded in
                            all things.&#8221; Even in a government where God might command and direct in
                            everything, the condition would be inferior to what it would be in a
                            community of enlightened freemen, enjoying the fullness of the Gospel,
                            filled with the knowledge of the heavens, doing good of their own
                            accord, governing themselves, loving their neighbors and doing all
                            things with an eye single to the glory of God. <small>(Conference

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span style="font-family: arial;">Several
                            weeks ago I had in my office a four-star general and his wife; they
                            were very impressive people. They admire the Church because of the
                            conduct of our youth. The general's wife mentioned her children, of
                            whom she is justly proud. But she expressed a deep concern. "Tell me,"
                            she said, "how you are able to control your youth and build such
                            character as we have seen in your young men?&#8221;</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            I was interested in her use of the word 'control'. The answer, I told
                            them, centered in the doctrines of the gospel. They were interested; so
                            I spoke briefly of the doctrine of agency. I said we develop control by
                            teaching freedom. Perhaps at first they thought we start at the wrong
                            end of the subject. A four-star general is nothing if not a
                            disciplinarian. But when one understands the gospel, it becomes very
                            clear that the best control is self-control.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            It may seem unusual at first to foster self-control by centering on
                            freedom of choice, but it is a very sound doctrinal approach.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            While either subject may be taught separately, and though they may
                            appear at first to be opposites, they are in fact parts of the same
                            subject.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Some who do not understand the doctrinal part do not readily see the
                            relationship between obedience and agency. And they miss one vital
                            connection and see obedience only as restraint. They then resist the
                            very thing that will give them true freedom. There is no true freedom
                            without responsibility, and there is no enduring freedom without a
                            knowledge of the truth. The Lord said, "If ye continue in my word, then
                            are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth
                            shall make you free." (John 8:31-32.)</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            The general quickly understood a truth that is missed even by some in
                            the Church. Latter-day Saints are not obedient because they are
                            compelled to be obedient. They are obedient because they know certain
                            spiritual truths and have decided, as an expression of their own
                            individual agency, to obey the commandments of God.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            We are the sons and daughters of God, willing followers, disciples of
                            the Lord Jesus Christ, and "under this head are [we] made free."
                            (Mosiah 5:8.)</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Those who talk of blind obedience may appear to know many things, but
                            they do not understand the doctrines of the gospel. There is an
                            obedience that comes from a knowledge of the truth that transcends any
                            external form of control. We are not obedient because we are blind, we
                            are obedient because we can see. The best control, I repeat, is
                            self-control.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            The general knew then why we teach our children the doctrines of the
                            gospel of Jesus Christ and where they get the resolute determination to
                            protect individual freedom. <small>(&#8220;Agency and Control,&#8221; <span

                            that agency is strengthened by our faith and obedience. Agency leads us
                            to act: to seek that we may find, to ask that we may receive guidance
                            from the Spirit, to knock on that door that leads to spiritual light

                            addiction serves the design of the prince of darkness, for it disrupts
                            the channel to the holy spirit of truth. At present, the adversary has
                            an unfair advantage. Addiction has the capacity to disconnect the human
                            will and nullify moral agency. It can rob one of the power to decide.

                            lights of a personal nature are activated for many reasons. For
                            example, the use of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, or pornography would turn
                            on warning lights, because when we choose to use these substances, we
                            become slaves and our moral agency is limited. We must be prepared with
                            preconditioned responses to reject these things when they are offered
                            to us, or we will jeopardize our right to have the Spirit to guide us

                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Gift of the Holy Ghost.</span> In
                            D&amp;C 33:16, the Lord revealed that &#8220;the power of [his] Spirit
                            quickeneth all things.&#8221; I believe that &#8220;all things&#8221; means all things.
                            He will not usurp or override our moral agency, but when given an
                            invitation, his Spirit will augment and accelerate our agency. When the
                            Spirit, the gift of the Holy Ghost, is given a chance to influence us,
                            decisions become easier and despair dissipates as solutions to our
                            challenges become clearly evident.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            The Book of Mormon prophets make it very clear that the Holy Ghost is
                            willing to exert a very powerful influence in our lives when we are
                            responsive to his promptings. Nephi, Mormon, and Ether explained that
                            the Spirit strives with us to guide our lives on righteous paths (see 2
                            Ne. 26:11; Morm. 5:16; Ether 2:15). Moroni proclaimed that the Spirit
                            persuades us to do good (see Ether 4:11&#8211;12). Amulek taught that the
                            Holy Ghost contends with us to do that which is right (see Alma 34:38),
                            and King Benjamin explained that the Holy Ghost entices us to be
                            righteous (see Mosiah 3:19).</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            The promptings of the Spirit were never intended to supplant our moral
                            agency, but the Spirit will underscore preferable options in our
                            behavior and clarify a certain course of action in our hearts and minds.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Savior&#8217;s Example.</span> Jesus
                            Christ set the perfect example for us. Without boasting, he
                            acknowledged that &#8220;the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always
                            those things that please him&#8221; (John 8:29). He has extended to each of
                            us the invitation to &#8220;learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the
                            meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me&#8221; (D&amp;C 19:23).</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scripture.</span> Another
                            indispensable resource that assists us in using our agency wisely is
                            holy scripture. The Apostle Paul explained, &#8220;All scripture is given by
                            inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
                            correction, for instruction in righteousness&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:16). Nephi gave
                            the additional prophetic promise that when we &#8220;feast upon the words of
                            Christ, &#8230; the words of Christ will tell [us] all things what [we]
                            should do&#8221; (2 Ne. 32:3). In short, the scriptures are our life script,
                            our instruction manual in mortality, if you will. But of course, if the
                            universal teachings in holy writ are to benefit us, we must follow
                            Nephi&#8217;s additional counsel to &#8220;liken all scriptures unto us, that it
                            might be for our profit and learning&#8221; (1 Ne. 19:23).</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Testimony. </span>We learn in the
                            book of Revelation that during the war in heaven, those who overcame
                            Satan and his followers did so &#8220;by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
                            word of their testimony&#8221; (see Rev. 12:7&#8211;11). A testimony was an
                            invaluable weapon in the war in heaven, and it is an indispensable
                            weapon here on earth.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            A testimony that is continually being nourished and is continually
                            growing will help us at every crossroad when important decisions are
                            made. Indeed, a testimony supplants the need to make certain decisions
                            under fire, because we already know well in advance the course of
                            action we will take.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Power of Prayer.</span> The
                            Apostle James eloquently observed that &#8220;the effectual fervent prayer of
                            a righteous man availeth much&#8221; (James 5:16). Alma the Elder would
                            certainly be an ardent advocate of this statement by James, for when
                            the angel appeared to Alma&#8217;s wayward son, he explained to Alma the
                            Younger that &#8220;the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also
                            the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed
                            with much faith concerning thee&#8221; (Mosiah 27:14).</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            &nbsp;All prayers are, indeed, answered, and it is well to remember
                            that sometimes the answer is not in the affirmative. As the Son of God
                            prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane that the bitter cup might pass, an
                            affirmative reply would have thwarted the entire plan of salvation. But
                            the Only Begotten Son demonstrated his meekness and humility and
                            obedience as he added: &#8220;Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done&#8221;
                            (Luke 22:42). The divine answer was no, but &#8220;there appeared an angel
                            unto him from heaven, strengthening him&#8221; (Luke 22:43). This is
                            certainly a prototype and a promise for each of us as we too are
                            required to drink from bitter cups in our lives. We will not be left
                            comfortless.</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fasting. </span>There are great
                            blessings promised to those who fast. Through the prophet Isaiah, the
                            Lord posed an important question, followed by profound promises: &#8220;Is
                            not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness,
                            to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that
                            ye break every yoke?&#8221; (Isa. 58:6.)</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            When we subordinate our physical needs and desires to the dictates of
                            the Spirit, we tap into a spiritual strength beyond our own. If we are
                            in bondage to bad habits or unkind thoughts, we can break the bands of
                            weakness or wickedness through fasting. Our hearts will be filled with
                            love and forgiveness, and we can get on with our lives after having
                            broken &#8220;every yoke.&#8221;</span></big><br>

                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ordinances.</span> Ordinances are
                            outward manifestations of inner covenants, commitments, and promises.
                            Ordinances are not optional on the pathway to perfection. These include
                            baptism and confirmation (see John 3:5; 2 Ne. 31:5&#8211;12); ordination to
                            the Melchizedek Priesthood, for all males (see D&amp;C 84:33&#8211;42); the
                            temple endowment and the sealing ordinance (see D&amp;C 132:15&#8211;24).</span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            Participation in ordinances helps us use our agency wisely and well,
                            and a constant commitment to covenants spares us the emotional energy
                            required to decide and re-decide what we are going to do each time we
                            face temptation. Each week, through the ordinance of the sacrament, we
                            solemnly covenant to &#8220;always remember him&#8221; (Moro. 4:3; Moro. 5:2;
                            emphasis added).</span></big><br>

                            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Living Prophets. </span>A loving
                            Heavenly Father has provided us with living prophets to receive and to
                            help us understand his mind and will. In speaking of his servants, the
                            Savior said: &#8220;And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the
                            Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be
                            the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice
                            of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation&#8221; (D&amp;C 68:4).
                            Elsewhere he declared that &#8220;whether by mine own voice or by the voice
                            of my servants, it is the same&#8221; (D&amp;C 1:38).</span></big><br>

                            as personal scripture for you&#8212;for that is what it is. A patriarchal
