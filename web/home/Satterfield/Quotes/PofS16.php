                            this was the first principle ever taught to man. When Adam, after being
                            driven from the garden of Eden, went to Adam-ondi-Ahman to offer
                            sacrifice,
                            the angel of the Lord asked him why he did so. Adam replied that he did
                            not know, but the Lord had commanded him to do it. He was then told
                            that
                            the blood of bulls and goats, of rams and lambs should be spilt upon
                            the
                            altar as a type of the great and last sacrifice which should be offered
                            up for the sins of the world. The first principle, then, ever taught to
                            Father Adam was faith in the Messiah, who was to come in the meridian
                            of
                            time to lay down his life for the redemption of man. The second

                            was repentance.<small> (<i>The Discourses of Wilford Woodruff</i>, p.18)</small>

                            Christ.
                            Why is it expedient to center confidence, hope, and trust in one
                            solitary

                            and hope in the world to come? My answer to these questions is derived
                            from a lifetime in His service and the confirmation of the Holy Spirit
                            that only Jesus Christ is uniquely qualified to provide hope,
                            confidence,
                            and strength to overcome the world and rise above our human failings.
                            This
                            is the reason I place my faith and trust in Him and strive to abide by

                            faith in Jesus Christ means. Faith in
                            Him
                            is more than mere acknowledgment that He lives. It is more than
                            professing
                            belief. Faith in Jesus Christ consists of complete reliance on Him. As
                            God, He has infinite power, intelligence, and love. There is no human
                            problem
                            beyond His capacity to solve. Because He descended below all things, He
                            knows how to help us rise above our daily difficulties. Faith in Him
                            means
                            believing that even though we do not understand all things, He does.
                            We,
                            therefore, must look to Him "in every thought; doubt not, fear not"
                            (D&amp;C
                            6:36). Faith in Him means trusting that He as power over all men and
                            all
                            nations. There is no evil that He cannot arrest. All things are in His
                            hands. This earth is His rightful dominion. Yet He permits evil so that
                            we can make choices between good and evil. <small>(<i>Teachings of

                            principle of true religion is faith. Jesus
                            Christ says, "Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of
                            God."
                            This is verily so. All people must be "born again" to be able to see
                            the
                            kingdom of God, or to be able to comprehend the ways of the Lord. Is
                            this
                            a mystery? No, it is plain and easily understood when we get the spirit
                            and light of God upon it. Jesus said also, "Except a man be born of the
                            water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." A
                            change
                            must take place in the human heart. Men must first be born of the word
                            of God, which lives and abides for ever. As the Apostle Peter says,
                            "being
                            born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word
                            of God, which liveth and abideth forever." The Apostle James says, "Of
                            his own will begat He us with the word of truth." And again we read,
                            "Faith
                            cometh by hearing the word of God." God's way is this: "He calls men
                            who
                            are fitted for His work, and inspires them, and endows them with
                            authority
                            to represent Him, and sends them forth to preach the word of God. When
                            they bear their testimony to people who are honest in their hearts, who
                            desire the truth and who wish to know of God, the Holy Spirit that is
                            in
                            the servants of God, the Spirit accompanying the word spoken by
                            authority,
                            enters the hearts of such people, and they are born of the word of God,
                            so that they can see and comprehend the truth. A change is wrought upon
                            them by the power and influence of divine truth, by which they are able
                            to see the truth as the speaker sees it; the word spoken by the gift
                            and
                            power of God carries conviction to the heart, and they at once begin to
                            recognize the authority of Him who imparts the words of life to them.
                            They
                            are born of the word and are able to see and understand to a certain
                            degree,
                            their faith and their ideas having been quickened by the power of God.
                            The light and influence of the Holy Ghost radiating and proceeding from
                            the inspired speaker, accompanies his word. As his testimony is borne
                            under
                            the influence of the Holy Ghost and by authority from on high,
                            conviction
                            seizes hold of the people, and if they are honest in their hearts and
                            desires,
                            it bears record in their souls. <small>(<i>Journal of Discourses</i>,

                            who are going in all parts of the world,
                            the message of the Church to all the world is: Repent of those things
                            which
                            contribute to the superiority of the physical senses over our love for
                            spirituality. That is why they cry repentance! What does repentance
                            mean?
                            A change of life, a change of thought, a change of action. If you have
                            been angry and hateful, change that hatred and enmity to love and
                            consideration.
                            If you have cheated a brother, let your conscience smite you and change
                            that, and ask his forgiveness, and never do it again. In thus changing
                            your life from those things which are on the animal plane, you repent
                            of
                            your sins. If you profane Deity, never do it again! Instead of
                            profaning
                            his name, worship him! And once that feeling of change comes to the
                            soul,
                            you desire to be born again, to have a new life. . . .This changing of
                            life, this repenting is what the world needs. It is a change of heart.
                            Men must change their way of thinking! Change their way of feeling!
                            Instead
                            of hating and fighting and crushing one another, they should learn to
                            love! <small>(<i>Gospel Ideals</i>, p.328)</small></big></big></li>

                            taught that "no flesh can dwell in the presence
                            of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy and grace of the Holy
                            Messiah" (2 Nephi 2:8). Even the most just and upright man cannot save
                            himself solely on his own merits, for, as the Apostle Paul tells us,
                            "all
                            have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
                            Therefore,
                            repentance means more than simply a reformation of behavior. Many men
                            and
                            women in the world demonstrate great will-power and self-discipline in
                            overcoming bad habits and the weaknesses of the flesh. Yet at the same
                            time they give no thought to the Master, sometimes even openly
                            rejecting
                            Him. Such changes of behavior, even if in a positive direction, do not
                            constitute true repentance. Repentance involves not just a change of
                            actions,
                            but a change of heart.

                    <big><big>As we seek to qualify to be members of Christ's
                            Church -- members in the sense in which He uses the term, members who
                            have
                            repented and come unto Him -- let us remember these principles. The
                            gospel
                            is the Lord's plan of happiness and repentance is designed to bring us
                            joy. True repentance is based on and flows from faith in the Lord Jesus
                            Christ. There is no other way. True repentance involves a change of
                            heart
                            and not just a change of behavior (see Alma 5:13). Part of this mighty
                            change of heart is to feel godly sorrow for our sins. This is what is
                            meant
                            by a broken heart and a contrite spirit. God's gifts are sufficient to
                            help us overcome every sin and weakness if we will but turn to Him for
                            help. Most repentance does not involve sensational or dramatic changes,
                            but rather is a step by step, steady and consistent movement toward
                            godliness.

                                style="font-weight: bold;">WHY BAPTISM MUST BE BY IMMERSION.</span>
                            The mode of baptism
                            is by immersion in water. Sprinkling or pouring did not come into vogue
                            until two or three centuries after Christ, and such a practice was not
                            universal until about the 13th century A.D. We have to go into history
                            to find these particulars. Baptism cannot be by any other means than
                            immersion
                            of the entire body in water, for the following reasons:
                        </big></big><br>
                    <big><big>&nbsp;</big></big><br>
                    <big><big>1. It is in the similitude of the death, burial,
                            and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and of all others who have received
                            the
                            resurrection.

                </div>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>2. Baptism
                        is also a birth and is performed in the
                        similitude of the birth of a child into this world.
                        <br>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>3. Baptism
                        is not only a figure of the resurrection,
                        but also is literally a transplanting or resurrection from one life to
                        another -- from the life of sin to the life of spiritual life.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;<br>
                        I want to take up the second reason: Baptism is
                        also a birth and is performed in the similitude of the birth of a child
                        into this world. When this earth was created, it came into existence
                        the
                        same way. (I am not speaking scientifically, and yet scientific
                        doctrine
                        tells us the same thing.) This earth was born in water. Before the land
                        appeared the whole sphere was covered with water.

                            style="font-weight: bold;">BIRTH COMES BY WATER, BLOOD, AND SPIRIT</span>.
                        In the
                        Book of Moses we read: "Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to
                        teach
                        these things freely unto your children, saying: That by reason of
                        transgression
                        cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were
                        born
                        into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made,
                        and so became of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again into
                        the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by
                        blood, even the blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be
                        sanctified
                        from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and
                        eternal
                        life in the world to come, even immortal glory; For by the water ye
                        keep
                        the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justified, and by the blood ye
                        are
                        sanctified." That is one of the finest passages I know, and we find
                        practically
                        the same thing recorded by John.

                            style="font-weight: bold;">SAME ELEMENTS PRESENT IN FIRST AND SECOND
                            BIRTHS</span>.
                        Every child that comes into this world is carried in water, is born of
                        water, and of blood, and of the spirit, So when we are born into the
                        kingdom
                        of God, we must be born in the same way. By baptism, we are born of the
                        water. Through the shedding of the blood of Christ, we are cleansed and
                        sanctified: and we are justified, through the Spirit of God, for
                        baptism
                        is not complete without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You see the
                        parallel
                        between birth into the world and birth into the kingdom of God. How
                        foolish
                        it is to think for a moment that baptism could be accomplished by
                        pouring
                        water on a child's head, it does not meet the requirements.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I have
                        heard some of our young elders preaching
                        on baptism say that the Lord could have brought to pass the remission
                        of
                        sins in some other way. They reasoned he could have done it by
                        sprinkling,
                        or in this way or that way. The Lord could not consistently do it any
                        other
                        way, only by being buried in the water, born of water and of the
                        spirit,
                        and cleansed by the blood of Christ, just as a child is born into this
                        world of water, blood, and spirit. The comparison is very striking.

                        Coming now to the
                        third reason: Baptism is not only a figure of the resurrection, but
                        also
                        is literally a transplanting or resurrection from one life to another
                        --
                        from the life of sin to the life of spiritual life. For proof of that,
                        I am going to read first something the Lord said to Joseph Smith.

                        I, the Lord God, caused that he [Adam]
                        should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because
                        of
                        his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the
                        first

                        have two conditions, spiritual life and
                        spiritual death. The condition of Adam in the Garden of Eden was
                        spiritual
                        life. He was in the presence of God. Through his transgression, he was
                        banished into spiritual death -- a new life entirely. He was no longer
                        in the presence of God. He was shut out, separated, a veil drawn
                        between
                        him, and the Lord.

                        Adam, after the fall, was in spiritual death, and
                        not only Adam but every man and woman upon the face of the earth who is
                        accountable before God, We will not consider the last death more than
                        to
                        say it is also banishment from the presence of God.

                        repentance.
                        Death is banishment. They are in spiritual death. How are they going to
                        get back? By being buried in the water. They are dead and are buried in
                        the water and come forth in the resurrection of the Spirit back into

                            style="font-weight: bold;">WHY BAPTISM REMITS FUTURE SINS</span>. I
                        have heard some
                        of our young men, and some not so young, when talking on baptism, say
                        they
                        do not know why it is, since baptism is for the remission of sins, that
                        a man does not have to be baptized every time he commits a sin. Do you
                        see the reason? As long as a man sins and stays within spiritual life,
                        he is alive, he can repent and be forgiven. He does not need to be
                        baptized
                        to be brought back to where he already is, But there are sins, John
                        says,
                        "unto death," and if a man commits a sin unto death, he is banished
                        again
                        and comes back into spiritual death.
                        <br>
                    </big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Through
                        this kind of transgression he loses the
                        effect of baptism and is banished into spiritual death. When a man
                        commits
                        a sin unto death, he is banished from spiritual life. The shedding of
                        innocent
                        blood is one such sin and blasphemy against the Holy Ghost another. The
                        enemies of the Prophet Joseph Smith carried him off to Carthage and put
                        him and his brother to death. Deliberately murdering the servants of
                        God
                        is the shedding of innocent blood.

                        sins unto death, he goes back again to
                        spiritual death, but as long as he stays within spiritual life, he does
                        not have to be baptized again.

                        Paul had
                        that very clearly in mind. He says, in writing to the Romans: "What

                        How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? Know ye
                        not,
                        that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized

                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big>Paul is speaking to members of
                            the Church. We are
                            dead to sin because we have left it. Banishment works one way as well
                            as
                            the other. In other words, when we are in spiritual life (or in the
                            Church
                            or in the kingdom of God), we ought not to sin. Through baptism we come
                            back from the spiritual death which is upon all unbaptized men. Whether
                            they are Roman Catholic or Protestant, if they are unrepentant and
                            unbaptized
                            they are in spiritual death. But we who have received the gospel, why
                            should
                            we live in sin when we have been baptized and are in spiritual life?

                            come back into the presence of God if we do not see him? We do not see
                            him now, but are we not in his presence when we have the gift of the
                            Holy
                            Ghost, one of the members of the Godhead, to lead and direct us in
                            righteousness?
                            We are back in his presence, if we keep the commandments and do not

                    <big><big></big></big><li><big><big>There are two Comforters spoken
                            of. One is the Holy Ghost, the same as
                            given on the day of Pentecost, and that all Saints receive after faith,
                            repentance, and baptism. This first Comforter or Holy Ghost has no
                            other
                            effect than pure intelligence. It is more powerful in expanding the
                            mind,
                            enlightening the understanding, and storing the intellect with present
                            knowledge, of a man who is of the literal seed of Abraham, than one
                            that
                            is a Gentile, though it may not have half as much visible effect upon
                            the
                            body; for as the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of
                            Abraham,
                            it is calm and serene; and his whole soul and body are only exercised
                            by
                            the pure spirit of intelligence; while the effect of the Holy Ghost
                            upon
                            a Gentile, is to purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the
                            seed of Abraham. That man that has none of the blood of Abraham
                            (naturally)
                            must have a new creation by the Holy Ghost. In such a case, there may
                            be
                            more of a powerful effect upon the body, and visible to the eye, than
                            upon
                            an Israelite, while the Israelite at first might be far before the
                            Gentile
                            in pure intelligence. . . . The Spirit of Revelation is in connection
                            with
                            these blessings. A person may profit by noticing the first intimation
                            of
                            the spirit of revelation; for instance, when you feel pure intelligence
                            flowing into you, it may give you sudden strokes of ideas, so that by
                            noticing
                            it, you may find it fulfilled the same day or soon; (i.e.,) those
                            things
                            that were presented unto your minds by the Spirit of God, will come to
                            pass; and thus by learning the Spirit of God and understanding it, you
                            may grow into the principle of revelation, until you become perfect in
                            Christ Jesus. <small>(<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith</i>,

                            had been baptized we were anxious to have
                            hands laid upon our heads that we might receive the gift of the Holy
                            Ghost.
                            In using that term, the "gift of the Holy Ghost," we do not mean some
                            particular
                            gift of the Spirit, but the gift of the Spirit itself--the Holy Ghost
                            given
                            unto us as a gift from God. We will find that term, "gift of the Holy
                            Ghost,"
                            used in the old Scriptures, and in the latter day Scriptures. It is the
                            Holy Ghost itself given unto us as a gift from the Almighty. "Then laid
                            they their hands upon them and they received the Holy Ghost." The
                            promise
                            is to those who will repent and be baptized for the remission of sins;
                            they shall receive "the gift of the Holy Ghost." What is it? It is a
                            greater
                            and higher endowment of the same spirit which enlightens every man that
                            comes into the world; a greater power given unto us as an abiding
                            witness,
                            to be a light to our feet and a lamp to our path; as a restraint
                            against
                            sin, to guide us into all truth, to open up the vision of the mind, to
                            bring things past to our remembrance, and to make manifest things to
                            come.
                            It is the spirit of truth that reveals the things of the Father and the
                            Son, proceeding from the presence of the Almighty and the very glory in
                            which He is enrobed, which makes him like unto a consuming fire. If we
                            receive that heavenly gift all are brought into communion with Him; we
                            can understand something concerning Him, that we may pattern after Him
                            until we become like Him; for if we are continually guided by that
                            spirit,
                            eventually we will come back to His presence and be able to enjoy the
                            fullness
                            of His glory. And while we remain in the flesh He will not be a
                            stranger
                            to us; we will not walk in the dark like the majority of mankind, but
                            we
                            will be the children of the light, comprehending the truth as it is in
                            Him, and seeing the path in which we should walk. <small>(<i>Journal

                            is to be saved; to fall short of sanctification Is to fail to gain full
                            salvation. Only the sanctified gain eternal life. To be sanctified is
                            to
                            be clean; it is a state of purity and spotlessness in which no taint of
                            sin is found. Only those who die as to sin and are born again to
                            righteousness,
                            becoming thus new creatures of the Holy Ghost, are numbered with the

                        work and mission and ministry of the Holy
                        Spirit of God to sanctify the souls of men. This is his assigned labor
                        in the Eternal Godhead. How he does it we do not know, except that it
                        is
                        a work that can only be performed by a spirit being,
                        and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        hence the need for one of his personality, status, and standing in the
                        Supreme Presidency of the universe.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>Baptism of
                        the Spirit is the way and the means whereby
                        sanctification is made available. Thus, Jesus commands all the "ends of
                        the earth" to be baptized in water "that ye may be sanctified by the
                        reception
                        of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last
                        day."
                        (3 Nephi 27:20.) Truly, the Holy Ghost is a sanctifier, and the extent
                        to which men receive and enjoy the gift of the Holy Ghost is the extent
                        to which they are sanctified. In the lives of most of us,
                        sanctification
                        is an ongoing process, and we obtain that glorious status by degrees as
                        we overcome the world and become saints in deed as well as in name.

                            Ghost -- a Revelator </b>Light and truth
                        and knowledge may be gained in many ways. They come through the senses,
                        from experience, and by reason. When so received, man, of course, may
                        be
                        deceived. In their pure and perfect form they are manifest by
                        revelation,
                        through a process of Spirit speaking to spirit, of the Holy Spirit
                        whispering
                        to the properly attuned spirit within us. This also is his work,
                        mission,
                        and assigned ministry. He is a revelator. According to the eternal laws
                        that govern all things, he has power to convey and reveal truth to a
                        human
                        soul with absolute finality. There is never any deception or
                        uncertainty
                        when the Spirit speaks. And where the truths about God and faith and
                        salvation
                        are concerned, there is no way to gain them except by revelation from
                        the
                        Spirit.

                        have received the gift of the Holy Ghost
                        have this glorious promise: "God shall give unto you knowledge by his
                        Holy
                        Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, [knowledge]
                        that
                        has not been revealed since the world was until now." (D&amp;C 121:26.)
                        As Paul said: "The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
                        God." (1 Corinthians 2:10.) How do these hidden and unknown things come
                        from the Holy Ghost to us? As to this we know only that it is by
                        obedience
                        to those laws upon which the receipt of such heavenly truths is
                        predicated.
                        These are the laws of righteousness. "I will tell you in your mind and
                        in your heart," the Lord says, "by the [power of the] Holy Ghost, which
                        shall . . . dwell in your heart. Now, behold, this is the spirit of
                        revelation."
                        (D&amp;C 8:2-3.) And the presence of the spirit of revelation
                        identifies
                        the true church and kingdom of God on earth; where this is, there is
                        the
                        true church; and where there is no spirit of revelation there the true
                        church is not. <small>(<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>,

                            refer
                            to what the Prophet Joseph Smith said about revelation: "A person may

                            by noticing the first intimation of the spirit of revelation. For
                            instance,
                            when you feel pure intelligence flowing into you, it may give you
                            sudden
                            strokes of ideas so that by noticing it you may find it fulfilled the
                            same
                            day or soon. That is, those things that were presented into your minds
                            by the Spirit of God will come to pass, and thus by learning the Spirit
                            of God, and understanding it, you may grow into the principle of
                            revelation
                            until you become perfect in Christ Jesus."<small> (<i>Stand Ye In Holy

                            state, in a subordinate sense of the word. Or, in other words, these
                            attributes
                            are in embryo; and are to be gradually developed. They resemble a bud

                            a germ, which gradually develops into bloom, and then, by progress,
