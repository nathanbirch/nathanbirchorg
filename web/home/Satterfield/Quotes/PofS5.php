                            If the Lord declares that intelligence, something which we do not fully
                            understand, was co-eternal with him and always existed, there is no
                            argument that we can or should present to contradict it. Why he cannot
                            create intelligence is simply because intelligence, like time and
                            space, always existed, and therefore did not have to be created.
                            However, intelligences spoken of in the Book of Abraham were created,
                            for these are spirit children of God, begotten sons. <small>(<span

                            &#8226; Some of our writers have endeavored to explain what an intelligence
                            is, but to do so is futile, for we have never been given any insight
                            into this matter beyond what the Lord has fragmentarily revealed. We
                            know, however, that there is something called intelligence which always
                            existed. It is the real eternal part of man, which was not created nor
                            made. This intelligence combined with the spirit constitutes a
                            spiritual identity or individual. <small>(<span

                            correctives provide emancipating perspectives! The revelations, when
                            &#8220;pressed down, and shaken together,&#8221; emphasize that man is, at once, an
                            intelligence or spirit coeternal &#8211; but certainly not coequal &#8211; with God
                            (see Abr. 3:18). Thus, doctrinally, we are positioned very differently,
                            because &#8220;God is neither the source nor the cause of either moral or
                            natural evil&#8221; [in Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., Encyclopedia of Mormonism, 5

                                is thus the organizer of eternal intelligences, which can neither be

                            not coerce men since all intelligence is free to act for itself &#8220;in
                            that sphere in which God has placed it. &#8230; Behold, here is the agency of

                            mysterious problem of man&#8217;s origin. It shows that man, as a spirit, was
                            begotten and born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the
                            eternal mansions of the Father, prior to coming upon the earth in a
                            temporal body to undergo an experience in mortality. It teaches that
                            all men existed in the spirit before any man existed in the flesh, and
                            that all who have inhabited the earth since Adam have taken bodies and

                            numerous and specific to require citation. The purport of these
                            scriptures is to the effect that God the Eternal Father, whom we

                            Elohim is the Father in every sense in which Jesus Christ is so
                            designated, and distinctively He is the Father of spirits. Thus we read

                            written standards of scripture show that all people who come to this
                            earth and are born in mortality, had a pre-existent, spiritual
                            personality, as the sons and daughters of the Eternal Father. (See
                            Pearl of Great Price, Chap. 3, verses 5-7.) Jesus Christ was the
                            first-born. A spirit born of God is an immortal being. When the body
                            dies, the spirit does not die. In the resurrected state the body will
                            be immortal as well as the spirit. <small>(&#8220;Pre-existent States&#8221;

                            concern for us continues to this very moment. In our wonderful,
                            pre-earth home we had the opportunity to learn many eternal truths. Our
                            Heavenly Father wanted us to develop every godly quality, for He knew
                            that although each of us is unique, we all have within us the seeds of
                            godhood. Indeed, we yearned to be like Him. But He understood that we
                            could only progress to a certain point without the wisdom of experience
                            through mortality, including the trials and temptations that come to
                            all of us as a direct result of our physical bodies. Therefore our
                            Father's plan was created to help us reach our full potential. It would
                            be difficult and sometimes painful-for Him, perhaps, as well as for us.
                            But He knew it was the only way His children could grow and

                            SPIRITS GREATER THAN OTHERS. The spirits of men had their free agency,
                            some were greater than others, and from among them the Father called
                            and foreordained his prophets and rulers. Jeremiah and Abraham were two
                            of them. . . . The spirits of men were not equal. They may have had an
                            equal start, and we know they were all innocent in the beginning; but
                            the right of free agency which was given to them enabled some to
                            outstrip others, and thus, through the eons of immortal existence, to
                            become more intelligent, more faithful, for they were free to act for
                            themselves, to think for themselves, to receive the truth or rebel

                            The Lord declared through Moses the following:</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;Remember the
                            days of old, consider the years of many generations: . . . When the
                            Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated
                            the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the
                            number of the children of Israel.&#8221;</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">A similar passage to this occurs
                            in Acts where Paul declares to the Athenians that the Lord &#8220;hath made
                            of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the
                            earth, and hath determined the times, before appointed, and the bounds
                            of their habitation.&#8221;</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">These passages clearly indicate
                            that the numbers of the children of Israel were known and the bounds of
                            their habitation fixed, in the days of old when the Lord divided to the
                            nations their inheritance. We conclude, therefore, that there must have
                            been a division of the spirits of men in the spiritual world, and those
                            who were appointed to be the children of Israel were separated and
                            prepared for a special inheritance.&nbsp; <small>(<span

                            others-in choosing to do good, and thus they became the noble and great

                            3:23), and so in this earth, coming through a chosen lineage, those
                            noble and great ones are expected, as members of the Church and kingdom

                            the rebellious, who were cast out with Satan, there were obviously many
                            spirits with varying degrees of faithfulness.&nbsp; May we not assume
                            from these teachings that the progress and development we made as
                            spirits have brought privileges and blessings here according to our
                            faithfulness in the spirit world?&nbsp; Now don&#8217;t be too hasty in your
                            conclusions as to what conditions in mortality constitute the greater
                            privileges.&nbsp; That condition in life which gives the greatest
                            experience and opportunity for development is the one to be most
                            desired and any one so privileged is most favored of God. . . .</span></big><br

                            adversity is to have had the greatest opportunity.&nbsp; Just because
                            we haven&#8217;t been born rich, for instance, may be the greatest blessing
                            we could possibly have.&nbsp; Perhaps some physical infirmities might

                            history, as the Apostle Paul taught the men of Athens and as the Lord
                            revealed to Moses, determined by the faithfulness of each of those who
                            lived before this world was created.</span></big><br

                            God&#8221; preached by the apostle Paul, to those who were ignorantly
                            worshipping images of stone and brass and wood, and I quote:</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">

                            &#8220;And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the
                            face of the earth [now mark you this], and hath determined the times
                            before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</span></big><br

                            &#8220;That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him,
                            and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.&#8221; (Acts 17:24,

                            Here then again we have the Lord making a further enlightening
                            declaration to Moses as recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy:</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            &#8220;When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
                            separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according
                            to the number of the children of Israel.&#8221; (Deut. 32:8)</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Now, mind you, this was said to the children of Israel before they had
                            arrived in the &#8220;Promised Land,&#8221; which was to be the land of their
                            inheritance.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Then note this next verse: &#8220;For the Lord&#8217;s portion is his people; Jacob
                            is the lot of his inheritance.&#8221; (Deut. 32:9)</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;<br>
                            It would seem very clear, then, that those born to the lineage of
                            Jacob, who was later to be called Israel, and his posterity, who were
                            known as the children of Israel, were born into the most illustrious
                            lineage of any of those who came upon the earth as mortal
                            beings.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            All these rewards were seemingly promised, or foreordained, before the
                            world was. Surely these matters must have been determined by the kind
                            of lives we had lived in that premortal spirit world. Some may question
                            these assumptions, but at the same time they will accept without any
                            question the belief that each one of us will be judged when we leave
                            this earth according to his or her deeds during our lives here in
                            mortality. Isn&#8217;t it just as reasonable to believe that what we have
                            received here in this earth [life] was given to each of us according to
                            the merits of our conduct before we came here? <small>(&#8220;Understanding

                            They enter this life with the talents and capacities developed in
                            pre-existence.&nbsp; Abraham saw in vision the spirit hosts of men
                            before they were born, &#8220;and among all these there were many of the
                            noble and great ones.&#8221;&nbsp; It was of that select and talented group
                            that the Lord said: &#8220;These I will make my rulers.&#8221;&nbsp; And to
                            Abraham, the Father of the Faithful, one of the greatest of the Lord&#8217;s
                            earthly rulers, the comforting word came: &#8220;Thou art one of them; thou
                            wast chosen before thou wast born.&#8221; (Abraham 3:22-23.)&nbsp; Alma tells
                            us that those who are faithful high priests in this life were in fact
                            &#8220;called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the
                            foreknowledge of&nbsp; God on account of their exceeding faith and good
                            works&#8221; while they yet dwelt in his presence. (Alma 13:3.) To Jeremiah
                            the Lord said: &#8220;Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and
                            before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I
                            ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.&#8221; (Jeremiah 1:5.)</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">And as it is with the prophets,
                            so is it with all the chosen seed. &#8220;God&#8217;s elect,&#8221; as Paul calls them
                            (Romans 8:33), are especially endowed at birth with spiritual
                            talents.&nbsp; It is easier for them to believe the gospel than it is
                            for the generality of mankind.&nbsp; Every living soul comes into this
                            world with sufficient talent to believe and be saved, but the Lord&#8217;s
                            sheep, as a reward for their devotion when they dwelt in his presence,
                            enjoy greater spiritual endowments than their fellows.<small> (<span

                            is evident that at that council certain plans had been proposed and
                            discussed, and that after a full discussion of those principles, and
                            the declaration of the Father&#8217;s will pertaining to His design, Lucifer
                            came before the Father, with a plan of his own, saying, &#8220;Behold I, send
                            me, I will be thy Son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul
                            shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore, give me thine
                            honor.&#8221;&nbsp; But Jesus, on hearing this statement made by Lucifer,
                            said &#8220;Father, they will be done, and the glory be thine forever.&#8221;&nbsp;
                            From these remarks made by the well beloved Son, we should naturally
                            infer that in the discussion of this subject the Father had made known
                            His will and developed His plan and design pertaining to these matter,
                            and all that His well beloved Son wanted to do was to carry out the
                            will of His Father, as it would appear had been before expressed.&nbsp;
                            He also wished the glory to be given to His Father, who, as God the
                            Father, and the originator and designer of the plan, had a right to all
                            the honor an glory.&nbsp; But Lucifer wanted to introduce a plan
                            contrary to the will of his Father, and then wanted His honor, and
                            said:&nbsp; &#8220;I will save every soul of man, wherefore give me thine
                            honor.&#8221;&nbsp; He wanted to go contrary to the will of his Father, and
                            presumptuously sought to deprive man of his free agency, thus making
                            him a serf, and placing him in a position in which it was impossible
                            for him to obtain that exaltation which God designed should be man&#8217;s,
                            through obedience to the law which He had suggested; and again, Lucifer
                            wanted the honor and power of his Father, to enable him to carry out
                            principles which were contrary to the Father&#8217;s wish.</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">And further, in regard to
                            agency; if man had not had his agency, or if he had been deprived of
                            his agency, he could not have been tempted of the devil, or of any
                            other power; for if they will of God prevailed, and was carried out
                            without man&#8217;s action or agency, it would have been impossible for him
                            to have done anything wrong, for he would have been deprived of the
                            power of doing that wrong.&nbsp; This was the position that Satan
                            desired to place not only the spirits in the heavens, but also mankind
                            upon the earth.&nbsp; And Satan said, &#8220;Surely I will save every one of
                            them, wherefore, give me thine honor.&#8221;&nbsp; But God&#8217;s plan was
                            different from this, and, as stated above, had been decided upon in the
                            Councils of heaven; and the Father had made a decree as to how these
                            things should be done; and that both the inhabitants of heaven and the
                            inhabitants of the earth should have their free agency.&nbsp; It was
                            against this that Lucifer rebelled; and he could not have rebelled
                            against a plan or commandment that had not been given; for rebellion
                            signifies a violation of law, command, or authority; and he was cast
                            out of heaven because of the rebellion.&nbsp; This rebellion could not
                            have existed without a free agency; for without a free agency they
                            would all have been compelled to do the will of the Father.&nbsp; But
                            having the free agency, they used it; and Lucifer and a third part of
                            the angels were cast out because they rebelled and used this agency in
                            opposition to their Heavenly Father.&nbsp; And not only because they
                            rebelled, but because, as stated, &#8220;they sought to destroy the agency of
                            man,&#8221;&nbsp; and their agency would have been used in opposition
                            to&nbsp; the interest, happiness and eternal exaltation of mankind,
                            which were proposed to be accomplished through the atonement and
                            redemption provided by Jesus Christ.&nbsp; [Quotes D&amp;C 29:36-39;
                            76:25-28).</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">There are other questions mixed
                            up with this rebellion besides those above referred to, and those
                            questions are directly connected with the atonement.&nbsp; In the event
                            of man having his free will and being subject to the power of
                            temptation, the weakness of the flesh, the allurements of the world,
                            and the powers of darkness, it was known that he must necessarily fall,
                            and being fallen, it would be impossible for him to redeem himself, and
                            that, according to an eternal law of justice, it would require an
                            infinite, expiatory atonement to&nbsp; redeem man, to save him from the
                            effects and ruin of the Fall, and to place him in a condition where he
                            could again reinstated in the favor of God, according to the eternal
                            laws of justice and mercy; and find his way back to the presence of the
                            Father.&nbsp; Satan (it is possible) being opposed to the will of his
                            Father, wished to avoid the responsibilities of this position, and
                            rather than assume the consequences of the acceptance of the plan of
                            the Father, he would deprive man of his free agency, and render it
                            impossible for him to obtain that exaltation which God designed.&nbsp;
                            It would further seem probable that he refused to take the position of
                            redeemer, and assume all the consequences associated therewith, but he
                            did propose, as stated before, to take another plan and deprive man of
                            his agency, and he probably intended to make men atone for their own
                            acts by an act of coercion, and the shedding of their own blood as an
                            atonement for their sins; therefore, he says, &#8220;I will redeem all
                            mankind, that one soul shall not be lost; and surely I will do it;
                            wherefore, give me thine honor.&#8221;&nbsp; His plan, however, was rejected
                            as contrary to the counsel of God, his Father,&nbsp; The well beloved
                            Son than addressed the Father, and instead of proposing to carry out
                            any plan of his own, knowing what His Father&#8217;s will was, said, &#8220;Thy
                            will be done;&#8221;&nbsp; `I will carry out thy plans and thy designs, and,
                            as man will fall, I will offer myself as an atonement according to thy
                            will, O God.&nbsp; Neither do I wish the honor, but thine be the
                            glory;&#8217;&#8221;&nbsp; and a covenant was entered into between Him and His
                            Father, in which He agreed to atone for the sins of the world; and He
                            thus, as stated, became the Lamb slain from before the foundation of
                            the world. &nbsp;</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span style="font-family: arial;">First,
                                that the proposition of Lucifer was an act of rebellion &#8220;against me&#8221; --
                                God.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                        <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Second, that God had already
                                decreed that man should have his free agency, and this agency had been
                                given to him by the Lord, as it is said, &#8220;which I, the Lord God, had
                                given him.&#8221;</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                        <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Third, that Lucifer coveted and
                                asked for a power which was the prerogative of the Almighty and alone
                                belonged to God; and which He called &#8220;mine own power.&#8221;</span></big><br

                        <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Fourth, that for this rebellion

                        <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Fifth, that the power by which
                                he was cast out, was by a certain power of Priesthood which had been
                                conferred by God on His Only Begotten; for he said, &#8220;By the power of
                                mine Only Begotten I caused that he should be cast down.&#8221;</span></big><br

                        <big><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></big><br>
                        <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Sixth, the being cast down and
                                becoming Satan, &#8220;even the devil, the father of lied,&#8221; his office was to

                            plan was presented in the great council. Before this earth was created
                            the Lord made a blueprint, as any great contractor will do before
                            constructing. He drew up the plans, wrote the specifications, and
                            presented them. He outlined it and we were associated with him. This
                            was probably when, according to the scientist, this earth was just a
                            nebulous mass in space. Our Father called us all together as explained
                            in the scripture, and plans were perfected now for forming an earth. In
                            his own words: &#8220;And there stood one among them that was like unto God,
                            and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is
                            space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an
                            earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see
                            if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command
                            them.&#8221; (Abraham 3:24-25.) That assemblage included us all. The gods
                            would make land, water, and atmosphere and then the animal kingdom, and
                            give dominion over it all to man. That was the plan. He gave it all to
                            man that man might grow and develop and perfect himself and become
                            godlike. <small>(<span style="font-style: italic;">The Teachings of

                            truth.... Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God
                            having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant
                            state, innocent before God.&#8221; &#8211; D.C. 93:21-23, 38.</span></big><br

                            this revelation we discover that in the beginning the spirits of all
                            men were innocent. What a happy condition that must have been! But it
                            was not to continue forever. In fact, we could not enjoy full
                            happiness, or joy, because our spirits had not received their
                            tabernacles of flesh by which it is possible for them to become
                            perfect. The Lord says: &#8220;For man is spirit. The elements are eternal
                            and spirit and element (or body), inseparably connected, receive a
                            fullness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fullness of
                            joy.&#8221; (Ibid. v. 33-34.) So it was impossible for the pre-existing
                            spirits to receive a fullness of joy. It is equally impossible for us
                            in this mortal life to receive a fullness of joy, because the spirit
                            and the body are not inseparably connected.</span></big><br

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore,
                            there had to come a change. Preparations were made by which we could
                            pass through this mortal probation, receiving tabernacles of flesh that
                            we might go on to perfection. To bring about this change and to give to
                            us the additional blessings, it was necessary that we also come in
                            contact with pain, temptation and sin. In the world of spirits we could
                            not suffer physical pain and understand the various conditions which
                            are peculiar to mortal life. That we might have the knowledge of these
                            things we had to experience them. The Father, therefore, through his
                            Son, made known to us the plan of salvation. The full purpose of
                            existence was explained to us in a grand council held in the heavens.
                            We were informed that when we came to this present world we would have
                            to suffer the ills of mortality. Among these ills we would be tried and
                            tempted and only those who were willing to abide in the covenants of
                            the Lord &#8211; which would be given us here&#8211;should have the privilege of
                            returning again to his presence. We were told that many would fail
                            because they would yield to sin and would reject the counsels of the
                            Father, for their exaltation could only come on merit. Agency should be
                            given us, and therefore each individual should have the privilege of
                            choosing for himself whether he would keep the commandments of the Lord
                            or whether he would rebel and follow sin. However, all should be
                            rewarded according to their works and should be graded accordingly.</span></big><br

                            Savior, in presenting the plan, said &#8220;unto those who were with him: We

                            We understand that the purpose of the Council in Heaven was to announce
                            and present the plan of redemption for the salvation of all of God&#8217;s
                            children. The council was called so that every man and woman could
                            sustain the provisions of the Father&#8217;s plan, which required that all
                            people obtain mortal bodies, be tried and proven in all things, and
                            have opportunity to choose of their own free will to obey the laws and
                            ordinances essential to their exaltation.</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Because a fallen condition was an essential part of this plan, an
                            infinite, eternal sacrifice was also required to redeem us from this
                            state. We are all familiar with the facts: how Lucifer&#8211;a personage of
                            prominence&#8211;sought to amend the plan, while Jehovah sustained the plan.
                            The central issue in that council, then, was: Shall the children of God
                            have untrammeled agency to choose the course they should follow,
                            whether good or evil, or shall they be coerced and forced to be
                            obedient? Christ and all who followed Him stood for the former
                            proposition &#8211; freedom of choice; Satan stood for the latter &#8211; coercion
                            and force. Because Satan and those who stood with him would not accept
                            the vote of the council, but rose up in rebellion, they were cast down
                            to the earth, where they have continued to foster the same plan. The
                            war that began in heaven is not yet over. The conflict continues on the
                            battlefield of mortality. And one of Lucifer&#8217;s primary strategies has
                            been to restrict our agency through the power of earthly governments.
                            Proof of this is found in the long history of humanity (see <span

                            4:6&#8211;7, Alma 34:9). He is the captain of our salvation and the only
                            means through whom we can return to our Father in Heaven to gain that

                            in the council of heaven. He sought to destroy the agency of man. He
                            rebelled (see Moses 4:3). There was a war in heaven, and a third of the
                            hosts were cast to the earth and denied a body (see Revelation 12:7&#8211;9,
                            D&amp;C 29:36&#8211;37). Lucifer is the enemy of all righteousness and seeks
                            the misery of all mankind (see 2 Nephi 2:18, 27; Mosiah 4:14).</span></big><br

                            Having proved faithful in their first estate in heaven, they are now
                            subject to the test of mortality in this second estate. That test

                            Father in Heaven wanted our growth to continue in mortality and to be
                            enhanced by our freedom to choose and learn. He also wanted us to
                            exercise our faith and our will, especially with a new physical body to
                            master and control. But we know from both ancient and modern revelation
                            that Satan wished to deny us our independence and agency in that
                            now-forgotten moment long ago, even as he wishes to deny them this very
                            hour. Indeed, Satan violently opposed the freedom of choice offered by
                            the Father, so violently that John in the Revelation described &#8220;war in
                            heaven&#8221; (Revelation 12:7) over the matter. Satan would have coerced us,
                            and he would have robbed us of that most precious of gifts if he could:
                            our freedom to choose a divine future and the exaltation we all hope to
                            obtain.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Through Christ and his valiant
                            defense of our Father&#8217;s plan, the course of agency and eternal
                            aspirations prevailed. In that crucial, premortal setting, a major
                            milestone was passed, a monumental victory was won. As a result, we
                            would be allowed to continue to pursue what President David O. McKay
                            once described as the &#8220;eternal principle of progress.&#8221; Later Christ
                            himself would come to earth, President McKay noted, &#8220;to perfect society
                            by perfecting the individual, and only by the exercising of Free Agency
                            can the individual even approach perfection&#8221; (In Conference Report,
                            Apr. 1940, p. 118). <small>(&#8220;The Golden Thread of Choice,&#8221; <span

                            the Eternal Father, the Father of the Firstborn and of all the spirit
                            hosts, as an exalted and glorified Being, having all power and
                            dominion, possessing all knowledge and all truth, personifying and
                            being the embodiment of all godly attributes, did, of his own will,
                            ordain and establish the plan of salvation whereby Christ and all his
                            other spirit children might have power to advance and progress and
                            become like him.</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">God ordained the plan. He
                            established it. It is his plan. It was not adopted by the Father
                            following one suggestion coming from Christ and another originating
                            with Lucifer. The Father is the author of the plan of salvation, a plan
                            that he created so that Christ, his Firstborn, plus all the rest of his
                            spirit children might be saved. As Joseph Smith expressed it: &#8220;God
                            himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he
                            was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest
                            could have a privilege to advance like himself.&#8221; (Teachings, p. 354.)</span></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;"></span></big><br>
                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">The Father&#8217;s plan, known first
                            as the gospel of God, was taught to Christ, to Lucifer, and to all our
                            Father&#8217;s spirit children. Each person, endowed with the divine power of
                            agency, was free to believe or disbelieve, to obey or disobey, to
                            follow Elohim or reject his goodness and grace. The plan itself
                            included the creation and peopling of an earth. God&#8217;s children were to
                            have the privilege of gaining mortal bodies and of being tried and
                            tested in a probationary estate to see if they would keep their
                            Father&#8217;s commandments at all hazards. The plan called for one of
                            Deity&#8217;s spirit sons to be born into mortality as the Only Begotten in
                            the flesh, who would thus inherit from the Father the power of
                            immortality; it called for this Chosen One to work out an infinite and
                            eternal atonement whereby fallen men would be raised in immortality,
                            while those who believed and obeyed world also gain eternal life.</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">After this plan had been taught
                            to all the hosts of heaven; after it was known and understood by all;
                            after all its facets had been debated and evaluated -- then the Father
                            asked for a volunteer to put the full terms and all of the conditions
                            of his plan into force. Then it was, after all else was in readiness,
                            that the call went forth in the Grand Council, &#8220;Whom shall I send&#8221; to
                            be the Savior and Redeemer? (Abr. 3:27.) That is: Who will work out the
                            infinite and eternal atoning sacrifice? Who will champion my cause? Who
                            will go forth and do my will? Who will put all the terms and conditions
                            of my plan in operation? Who will be my Son? Who will be the Messiah?</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">And thus the scene was set; thus
                            the appointed time had come; thus the choosing and foreordination of
                            the Messiah was at hand!</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                            power and influence, two whose voices had been heard by all the hosts
                            of heaven, stepped forth to answer the Father&#8217;s call, &#8220;Whom shall I
                            send?&#8221; (Abr. 3:27.) One was Christ, the other Lucifer.&nbsp; Our Lord
                            said: &#8220;Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.&#8221;
                            (Moses 4:2.) That is: `Father, I accept all of the terms and conditions
                            of thy plan. I will do thy will. I will go down as thy Son, the Only
                            Begotten in the flesh. With thy help I will atone for the sins of the
                            world, and will ascribe the honor and the glory unto thee in all
                            things.&#8217;</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Lucifer said: &#8220;Behold, here am
                            I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one
                            soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me
                            thine honor.&#8221; (Moses 4:1.) That is: &#8216;I reject thy plan. I am willing to
                            be thy Son and atone for the sins of the world, but in return let me
                            take thy place and sit upon thy throne. Yea, &#8220;I will ascend into
                            heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; . . . I will be
                            like the most High.&#8221;(Isa. 14:13-14.) . . .</span></big><br

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Then came the decree. The issue
                            was settled, except for the rebellion and war that was to follow. The
                            voice of the Almighty said: &#8220;I will send the first.&#8221; (Abr. 3:27.) The
                            God of heaven said: &#8220;My Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen
                            from the beginning,&#8221; shall be the Savior and Redeemer, the Deliverer
                            and Messiah. (Moses 4:2.)</span></big><br style="font-family: arial;">

                    <big><span style="font-family: arial;">Lucifer rebelled. He and
                            one-third of the hosts of heaven, all being of one mind and one spirit,
                            were cast down to earth, denied mortal bodies, and forever damned,
                            damned to suffer the fulness of the wrath of Him whose plan they
                            rejected. (Moses 4:3-4; Abr. 3:28; Rev. 12:7-9.)</span></big><br

                            Deliverer had adopted, advocated, and sponsored the Father&#8217;s plan. Now
                            with the decree issued that he should redeem and save mankind, that his
                            atonement would enable men to become like their Father and God, and
                            that the purposes of the Eternal Elohim should be brought to pass in
