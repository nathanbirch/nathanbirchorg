                                the Prophet that may be the basis of that apocraphal story.&nbsp;
                                According to Charles Lowell Walker, Wilford Woodruff "refered to a
                                saying of Joseph Smith, which he heard him utter (like this) That if
                                the People knew what was behind the vail, they would try by every means
                                to commit suicide that they might get there, but the Lord in his wisdom
                                had implanted the fear of death in every person that they might cling
                                to life and thus accomplish the designs of their creator."&nbsp; --

                            the Church is still
                            seeking. There
                            are today Word of Wisdom faddists who will not use white flour or
                            refined
                            sugar; there are so-called liberals who think the problems of religion
                            can be solved by dialogues and discussions without reference to
                            revelation;
                            there are others who maintain the Church should follow the world's
                            course
                            of social progress; there are those who try and harmonize the
                            evolutionary
                            concepts of the day with the revealed account of the fall and
                            atonement;
                            and there are others who profess to believe that full salvation is
                            reserved
                            for those who practice plural marriage, and so on. In other words,
                            there
                            are some of one philosophy and some of another, some follow the

                            of this cultish view and some of that. How apt it is that the Lord
                            chose
                            to paraphrase Paul's language concerning divisive groups in the Church,
                            when he spoke of those who shall be thrust down to hell, and who after
                            their sufferings shall come forth to receive a telestial inheritance.
                            "These

                        act of taking one's life is truly a tragedy because
                        this single act leaves so many victims: first the one who dies, then
                        the
                        dozens of others--family and friends--who are left behind, some to face
                        years of deep pain and confusion. The living victims struggle, often
                        desperately,
                        with difficult emotions. In addition to the feelings of grief, anger,

                        and rejection which the victims of such a family feel, Latter-day

                        carry an additional burden. The purpose of our mortal lives, we know,
                        is
                        to prove ourselves, to eventually return to live in the celestial

                        Let's
                        review some of the fundamental teachings of the prophets on this matter.</big></font>

                        President George Q. Cannon of the First Presidency
                        made a clear statement about the seriousness of suicide when he said:
                        "Man
                        did not create himself. He did not furnish his spirit with a human
                        dwelling
                        place. It is God who created man, both body and spirit. Man has no
                        right,
                        therefore, to destroy that which he had no agency in creating. They who
                        do so are guilty of murder, self-murder it is true; but they are no
                        more
                        justified in killing themselves than they are in killing others. What
                        difference
                        of punishment there is for the two crimes, I do not know; but it is
                        clear
                        that no one can destroy so precious a gift as that of life without
                        incurring
                        a severe penalty." (<i>Gospel Truth</i>, 2 vols., Salt Lake City:

                        Spencer W. Kimball made an equally strong statement
                        in 1976. "It is a terrible criminal act for a person to go out and
                        shorten
                        his life by suicide," he said. (<i>Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</i>,

                        late Elder Bruce R. McConkie, formerly of the Quorum
                        of the Twelve, expressed what many Church leaders have taught: "Suicide
                        consists in the voluntary and intentional taking of one's own life,
                        particularly
                        where the person involved is accountable and has a sound mind. &#8230;
                        Persons
                        subject to great stresses may lose control of themselves and become
                        mentally
                        clouded to the point that they are no longer accountable for their
                        acts.
                        Such are not to be condemned for taking their own lives. It should also
                        be remembered that judgment is the Lord's; he knows the thoughts,
                        intents,
                        and abilities of men; and he in his infinite wisdom will make all
                        things
                        right in due course." (<i>Mormon Doctrine</i>, Salt Lake City:

                        long ago I was asked to speak at the funeral of a
                        dear friend who had committed suicide. Knowing the person and the
                        circumstances
                        as I did, and researching the doctrine on the subject, I had some
                        difficult
                        moments in preparing for my remarks. I know that any fully rational
                        person
                        who contemplates suicide must realize what a terribly selfish act this
                        is. Peace came to me only when I recognized that only the Lord could
                        administer
                        fair judgment. He alone had all the facts, and only He would know the
                        intent
                        of the heart of my friend. I was reconciled with the idea that a
                        lifetime
                        of goodness and service to others must surely be considered by the Lord
                        in judging the life of a person. In the Lord's mercy, perhaps the words
                        of Alma will apply:</big></font>

                        proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power

                        as some of us seem to think. The Lord said, "Thou shalt not kill." Does
                        that mean that every [page 8] person who kills will be condemned, no
                        matter
                        the circumstances? Civil law recognizes that there are gradations in
                        this
                        matter--from accidental manslaughter to self-defense to first-degree
                        murder.
                        I feel that the Lord also recognizes differences in intent and
                        circumstances:
                        Was the person who took his life mentally ill? Was he or she so deeply
                        depressed as to be unbalanced or otherwise emotionally disturbed? Was
                        the
                        suicide a tragic, pitiful call for help that went unheeded too long or
                        progressed faster than the victim intended? Did he or she somehow not
                        understand
                        the seriousness of the act? Was he or she suffering from a chemical
                        imbalance
                        that led to despair and a loss of self-control?</big></font>

                        Kimball's The Miracle of Forgiveness gives us
                        insight into the accountability of some who commit suicide. "A minister
                        acquaintance of mine, whom I knew rather well, was found by his wife
                        hanging
                        in the attic from the rafters," President Kimball wrote. "His thoughts
                        had taken his life. He had become morose and despondent for two or more
                        years. Certainly he had not come to suicide in a moment, for he had
                        been
                        a happy, pleasant person as I had known him. It must have been a long
                        decline,
                        ever steeper, controllable by him at first and perhaps out of hand as
                        he
                        neared the end of the trail. No one in his 'right mind,' and especially
                        if he has an understanding of the gospel, will permit himself to arrive
                        at this 'point of no return.' " (<i>The Miracle of Forgiveness</i>,

                        the

                            draw an important conclusion from the words of the Prophet:
                            Suicide is a sin--a very grievous one, yet the Lord will not judge the
                            person who commits that sin strictly by the act itself. The Lord will
                            look
                            at that person's circumstances and the degree of his accountability at
                            the time of the act. Of course, this gives us no reason to excuse
                            ourselves
                            in committing sins, nor will the Lord excuse us, if I understand
                            correctly.
                            We must constantly strive to do our best in emulating the Savior in
                            every
                            aspect of our lives. At the same time, however, let us remember that
                            spiritual
                            growth comes "line upon line," that the key--in the spirit world as
                            well
                            as in mortality--is to keep progressing along the right path. (
