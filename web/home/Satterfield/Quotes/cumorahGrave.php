                                you of another circumstance that will be as marvelous as anything can
                                be. This is an incident in the life of Oliver Cowdery, but he did not
                                take the liberty of telling such things in meeting as I take. I tell
                                these things to you, and I have a motive for doing so. I want to carry
                                them to the ears of my brethren and sisters, and to the children also,
                                that they may grow to an understanding of some things that seem to be
                                entirely hidden from the human family. Oliver Cowdery went with the
                                Prophet Joseph when he deposited these plates. Joseph did not translate
                                all of the plates; there was a portion of them sealed, which you can
                                learn from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. When Joseph got the
                                plates, the angel instructed him to carry them back to the hill
                                Cumorah, which he did. Oliver says that when Joseph and Oliver went
                                there, the hill opened, and they walked into a cave, in which there was
                                a large and spacious room. He says he did not think, at the time,
                                whether they had the light of the sun or artificial light; but that it
                                was just as light as day. They laid the plates on a table; it was a
                                large table that stood in the room. Under this table there was a pile
                                of plates as much as two feet high, and there were altogether in this
                                room more plates than probably many wagon loads; they were piled up in
                                the corners and along the walls. The first time they went there the
                                sword of Laban hung upon the wall; but when they went again it had been
                                taken down and laid upon the table across the gold plates; it was
                                unsheathed, and on it was written these words: "This sword will never
                                be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom
                                of our God and his Christ." I tell you this as coming not only from
                                Oliver Cowdery, but others who were familiar with it, and who
                                understood it just as well as we understand coming to this meeting,
                                enjoying the day, and by and by we separate and go away, forgetting
                                most of what is said, but remembering some things. So is it with other
                                circumstances in life. I relate this to you, and I want you to
                                understand it. I take this liberty of referring to those things so that
                                they will not be forgotten and lost. Carlos Smith was a young man of as
                                much veracity as any young man we had, and he was a witness to these
                                things. Samuel Smith saw some things, Hyrum saw a good many things, but
                                Joseph was the leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (</span></big></big><big><big><span
