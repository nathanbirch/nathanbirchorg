                                        immediately; Paul says, "for I delight in the law of God, after the
                                        inward man," but I see another law in my members warring against the
                                        law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which
                                        is in my members." We have to fight continually, as it were, sword in
                                        hand to make the spirit master of the tabernacle, or the flesh subject
                                        to the law of the spirit. If this warfare is not diligently prosecuted,
                                        then the law of sin prevails, and in consequence of this some
                                        apostatize from the truth when crossing the plains, learn to swear
                                        instead of to pray, become high-minded and high tempered instead of
                                        learning to be patient and humble, and when they arrive in these
                                        vallies they feel so self-sufficient that they consider themselves the
                                        only ones that are really right; they are filled with darkness, the
                                        authority of the Spirit is not listened to, and the law of sin and
                                        death is the ruling power in their tabernacles. <small>(<i>Journal of
