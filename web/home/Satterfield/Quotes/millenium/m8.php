                        of the Church have an erroneous idea that when the millennium comes all
                        of the people are going to be swept off the earth except righteous
                        members of the Church. That is not so. There will be millions of
                        people, Catholics, Protestants, agnostics, Mohammedans, people of all
                        classes, and of all beliefs, still permitted to remain upon the face of
                        the earth, but they will be those who have lived clean lives, those who
                        have been free from wickedness and corruption. All who belong, by
                        virtue of their good lives, to the terrestrial order, as well as those
                        who have kept the celestial law, will remain upon the face of the earth
                        during the millennium. Eventually, however, the knowledge of the Lord
                        will cover the earth as the waters do the sea. But there will be need
                        for the preaching of the gospel, after the millennium is brought in,
                        until all men are either converted or pass away. In the course of the
                        thousand years all men will either come into the Church, or kingdom of
                        God, or they will die and pass away. In that day there will be no death
                        until men are old. Children will not die but will live to the age of a
                        tree. Isaiah says this is 100 years. When the time comes for men to
                        die, they will be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and there will be
                        no graves. <small>(<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, 1:86)</small></font></big></big></p>
