                        are legally adopted may, under proper circumstances, be sealed into the
                        families who adopted them. It is not possible, however, to rob the dead
                        of their children, if they are entitled to them, even if they are
                        adopted by others.</font></big></big></p>

                        a woman who has been sealed in the temple for time and eternity should
                        sin and lose the right to receive the exaltation in the celestial
                        kingdom, he or she could not retard the progress of the injured
                        companion who had been faithful. Everyone will be judged according to
                        his works, and there would be no justice in condemning the innocent for
                        the sins of the guilty.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">We may be
                        sure that the Lord is not going to permit any ordinance which we
                        perform incorrectly, through our lack of understanding, to be left
                        binding forever without correction. During the millennium there will be
                        a great deal of adjusting where we, for lack of proper knowledge, have
                        performed sealings ignorantly, but according to our best judgment. <small>(<em>Doctrines
