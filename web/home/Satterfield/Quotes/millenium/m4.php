                                who will receive them. Ere long the dark veil of ignorance and unbelief
                                that covers the earth and blinds the minds of men shall be pierced.
                                Light and truth will fall from heaven as does rain from the clouds

                                knowledge of God, the knowledge of those Gods whom it is life eternal
                                to know, shall be in every heart. No longer will theologians suppose
                                that God is a spirit essence that fills immensity while he dwells in
                                the human heart. No longer will philosophers pontificate about some
                                great first cause that inexplicably brought order into a chaotic
                                universe. No longer will Babylonish churches place crucifixes in the
                                hands, or the images of Diana of the Ephesians, as it were, and no
                                longer will they worship the works of their own hands in the great
                                cathedrals of Christendom. The knowledge of God, the truth about God,
                                the fact that he is a Holy Man, will come by revelation into every
                                human heart. The knowledge of God will cover the earth.</span></big></big><br

                                things are to be revealed in the millennial day. The sealed part of the
                                Book of Mormon will come forth; the brass plates will be translated;
                                the writings of Adam and Enoch and Noah and Abraham and prophets
                                without number will be revealed. We shall learn a thousand times more
                                about the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus than we now know. We shall
                                learn great mysteries of the kingdom that were not even known to those
                                of old who walked and talked with the Eternal One. We shall learn the
                                details of the creation and the origin of man and what fools mortals
                                are to follow the fads of the evolving evolutionary nonsense that
                                litters the textbooks of academia. Nothing in or on or over the earth
                                will be withheld from human ken, for eventually man, if he is to be as
                                his Maker, must know all things.</span></big></big><br

                                Hear in
                                this connection these words of Nephi: In that day, &#8220;the earth shall be
                                full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
                                Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all
                                things shall be made known unto the children of men. There is nothing
                                which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness
                                save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which
                                is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed. Wherefore, all things
                                which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be
                                revealed.&#8221; (2 Ne. 30:15-18.) Surely man could not ask for more than
                                this in the way of light and truth and knowledge, and yet expect to
                                remain in the flesh as a mortal and be in process of working out his
                                salvation. Surely this is the day in which the Lord shall fulfill the
                                promise of holy writ that says: &#8220;God shall give unto you knowledge by
                                his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost,
                                [knowledge] that has not been revealed since the world was until now;
                                which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be
                                revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the
                                angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory; a time to
                                come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God
                                or many gods, they shall be manifest.&#8221; (D&amp;C 121:26-28.) That this
                                outpouring of divine goodness has already commenced is not open to
                                question. That it will continue, in far greater measure, after our Lord
                                comes again, who can doubt?&nbsp; (<small><span

                                Comforter, and whereas but few have been blessed with this divine

                                What,
                                then, will be the nature of worship during the Millennium?&nbsp; It
                                will be pure and perfect, and through it men will become inheritors of
                                eternal life. And in this connection, be it known that it is the
                                privilege of the saints today to separate themselves from the world and
                                to receive millennial blessings in their lives. And any person who
                                today abides the laws that will be kept during the Millennium will
                                receive, here and now, the spirit and blessings of the Millennium in
                                his life, even though he is surrounded by a world of sin and evil. And
                                so we say, in the language of Joseph Smith as he finished the record of
                                the vision of the three degrees of glory: &#8220;Great and marvelous are the
                                works of the Lord, and the mysteries of his kingdom which he showed
                                unto us, which surpass all understanding in glory, and in might, and in
                                dominion; Which he commanded us we should not write while we were yet
                                in the Spirit, and are not lawful for man to utter; Neither is man
                                capable to make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood
                                by the power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who love
                                him, and purify themselves before him; To whom he grants this privilege
                                of seeing and knowing for themselves; That through the power and
                                manifestation of the Spirit, while in the flesh, they may be able to
                                bear his presence in the world of glory. And to God and the Lamb be
                                glory, and honor, and dominion forever and ever. Amen.&#8221; (D&amp;C
