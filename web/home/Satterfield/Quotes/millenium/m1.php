                        to an expansive, panoramic view of things. This should leave us

                        of man." (Moses 1:39.) President Brigham Young said there are millions
                        of earths like this one so that certain planets, as Isaiah said, are
                        formed to be inhabited (see Isa. 45:18) as God's plan of salvation is
                        executed and reexecuted! How glorious is our God! Truly, as the
                        Psalmist said, "We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his
                        hand." (Ps. 95:7.) Has he not even told us that his "course is one
                        eternal round"? (D&amp;C 3:2.) Are we not also given intriguing
                        intimations such as how "planets &#8230; move in their times and seasons" and
                        how "all these kingdoms, and the inhabitants thereof" are to know the
                        joy of seeing the countenance of the Lord - "every kingdom in its hour,
                        and in its time, and in its season"? (See D&amp;C 88:42, 43, 61.) <small>["Thanks

                        wanted to represent these kingdoms so that we could understand what he
                        desired to impart, and he gave it as a parable... Says the
                        interrogator--"I do not comprehend this idea of the Lord's withdrawing
                        from one and going to another." In order to comprehend this let us come
                        back to our own globe. Do we not expect that the Lord will, by and by,
                        come and visit us and stay a little while, about a thousand years. Yes,
                        and then we shall be made glad with the joy of the countenance of our
                        Lord. He will be among us, an will be our King, and he will reign as a
                        King of kings and Lord of lords. He will have a throne in Zion, and
                        another in the Temple at Jerusalem, and he will have with him the
                        twelve disciples who were with him during his ministry at Jerusalem;
                        and they will eat and drink with him at his table; and all the people
                        of the globe who are counted worthy to be called Zion, the pure in
                        heart, will be made glad by the countenance of their Lord for a
                        thousand years, during which the earth will rest. Then what? He
                        withdraws. What for? To fulfill other purposes; for he has other worlds
                        or creations and other sons and daughters, perhaps just as good as
                        those dwelling on this planet and they, as well as we, will be visited,
                        and they will be made glad with the countenance of their Lord. Thus he
                        will go, in the time and in the season thereof, from kingdom to kingdom
                        or from world to world, causing the pure in heart, the Zion that is
                        taken from these creations, to rejoice in his presence.<small> (<em>Journal

                        children of the Father, the Lord in our day has given us this parable:
                        [Quotes D&amp;C 88:51-62] Those who dwell with their lord in the day he
                        visits in their field shall be glorified. They are the meek who shall
                        inherit the earth; they are the God-fearing and the righteous. And they
                        in turn glorify their Lord, for they bring forth much fruit unto him.</font></big></big></p>

                        unto this parable I will liken all these kingdoms," he says, "and the

                        in its season, even according to the decree which God hath made."</font></big></big></p>

                        ponder in your hearts," he says, "with this commandment which I give
                        unto you, that ye shall call upon me while I am near." Truly, the time
                        draws near and the day will soon arrive when he will visit us in our
                        field, and if we are to find joy in his presence and glory in the light
                        of his countenance, we must make ourselves worthy. <small>(<em>The
