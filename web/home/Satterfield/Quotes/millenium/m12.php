                        we have not kept the commandments of the Lord, if we have been unjust,
                        and lovers of sin and our hearts have been set upon evil, then we shall
                        die and shall not live again until the thousand years are ended. It is
                        decreed that the unrighteous shall have to spend their time during this
                        thousand years in the prison house prepared for them where they can
                        repent and cleanse themselves through the things which they shall
                        suffer.</font></big></big></p>

                        great vision, saw the rest of the dead and they lived not again until
                        the thousand years were ended. That is a calamity -- it is a dreadful
                        thing to contemplate, for there shall be a great host of men swept off
                        the face of the earth because of their wickedness. The bodies of these
                        will have to remain in the grave and their spirits in the spirit house
                        to be taught repentance and faith in God while the thousand years of
                        peace are progressing upon the earth.</font></big></big></p>

                        good brethren and sisters, that we would read these revelations, that
                        we would make ourselves more familiar with that which they contain, for
                        there shall be a judgment when Christ comes. We are informed that the
                        books shall be opened, the dead shall be judged out of the things which
                        are written in the books and among the books will be the book of life.
                        We shall see its pages; we shall see ourselves just as we are. And we
                        are to understand with a righteous understanding that the judgments
                        which are meted out to us are just and true, whether we come into the
                        kingdom of God, to receive these glorious blessings, or whether we are
                        banished into the realm of the dead. <small>(<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>,
