                        will it be on this earth when Christ reigns?&#8230;When the Millennium dawns,
                        Satan bound and the elements of the earth at our disposal and under our
                        control, there will be no hunger, no thirst, no nakedness, no vagrants,
                        no houseless people; all will have that which is necessary to supply
                        their physical wants. But there will be no waste. One man will not be
                        allowed to lord it over another and take possession of more than he
                        needs; but all will have a fulness, Satan will be bound. He will not
                        have power to inflict the misery he has done and is doing.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">But how has
                        Satan obtained such power? By men obeying him instead of God. That is
                        the root of all the misery that comes upon mankind. When Satan is
                        bound, this will be stopped. He will not be able, for a thousand years
                        at least, to inflict upon mankind the misery and the sorrow that they
                        have suffered through their obedience to him.</font></big></big></p>

                        it was among the Nephites&#8230;. Men will arise who will object to working
                        for the benefit of others; class distinctions will once more make
                        themselves apparent; Satan will regain his power and will maintain it
                        until the great battle shall take place which is spoken of in the
                        scriptures.</font></big></big></p>

                        my definition of the word, there is not a strictly and fully civilized
                        community now upon the earth. Is there murder by wholesale to be found
                        in a strictly civilized community? Will a community of civilized
                        nations rise up one against another, nation against nation, and kingdom
                        against kingdom, using against each other every destructive invention
                        that can be brought to bear in their wars? When will they be civilized?
                        When the Lord shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
                        people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their
                        spears into pruninghooks; when nations shall not lift up sword against
                        nation, neither learn war any more. When the world is in a state of
                        true civilization, man will have ceased to contend against his
                        fellow-man, either as individuals, parties, communities, sects, or
                        nations. This state of civilization will be brought about by the holy
                        Priesthood of the Son of God; and men, with full purpose of heart, will
                        seeks unto him who is pure and holy, even our great Creator -- our
                        Father and God; and he will give them a law that is pure -- a
                        government and plan of society possessed by holy beings in heaven. Then
                        there will be no more war, no more bloodshed, no more evil-speaking and
                        ill-doing; but all will be contented to follow in the path of truth,
                        which alone is calculated to exalt and dignify the whole man, mentally
                        and physically, in all his operations, labors, and purposes. Short of
                        this, mankind cannot be said to be truly civilized. <small>(<em>Discourses

                        includes all things, and although the scriptures do not speak with

                        state of existence which was theirs in the Edenic day. But the revealed
                        word does have somewhat to say about the animal kingdom. "In that day,"
                        for one thing, "the enmity of man, and the enmity of beasts, yea, the
                        enmity of all flesh, shall cease from before my face," the Lord says.
                        (D&amp;C 101:26.) There will be no wild animals. The coyote will not
                        stalk the deer, and the wolf will not kill the sheep, and all forms of
                        life will be the friends and servants of men. </font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Isaiah gives
                        us these poetically phrased particulars about animal life during the
                        Millennium. "The wolf and the lamb shall feed together," he says, "and
                        the lion shall eat straw like the bullock." Implicit in this
                        pronouncement is the fact that man and all forms of life will be
                        vegetarians in the coming day; the eating of meat will cease, because,
                        for one thing, death as we know it ceases. There will be no shedding of
                        blood, because man and beast are changed (quickened) and blood no
                        longer flows in their veins. "And dust shall be the serpent's meat,"
                        meaning, as we suppose, that they shall no longer eat mice and vermin
                        and animal life. "They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
                        mountain, saith the Lord." (Isa. 65:25.) And further: "The wolf also
                        shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
                        and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little
                        child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young
                        ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
                        And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
                        weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den [adders' den].
                        They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain." (Isa.
                        11:6-9.) <small>(<em>The Millennial Messiah</em>, pp.657-658)</small></font></big></big></p>
