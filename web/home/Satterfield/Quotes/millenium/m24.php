                        - That a standard is to be lifted up, by the Lord, to the nations.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">4<sup>th</sup>
                        - That an Angel is to come with the everlasting Gospel, which is to be
                        proclaimed to every nation, kindred, people, and tongue; that it is to
                        be the same as the ancient one, and that the same powers and blessings
                        will attend it.</font></big></big></p>

                        - That not only will the Ancient Gospel be preached, but there will
                        accompany it a declaration of judgment to the nations.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">6<sup>th</sup>
                        - That there will be a literal Zion, or gathering of the Saints to
                        Zion, as well as a gathering of the Jews to Jerusalem.</font></big></big></p>

                        - That when this has taken place, the Spirit of God will be withdrawn
                        from the nations, and they will war with and destroy each other.</font></big></big></p>

                        - That the nations, having lost the Spirit of God, will assemble to
                        fight against the Lord's people, being full of the spirit of
                        unrighteousness, and opposed to the rule and government of God.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">10<sup>th</sup>
                        - That when they do, the Lord will come and fight against them himself;
                        overthrow their armies, assert his own right, rule the nations with a
                        rod of iron, root the wicked out of the earth, and take possession of
                        his own kingdom. I might here further state, that when the Lord does
                        come to exercise judgment upon the ungodly, to make an end of sin, and
                        bring in everlasting righteousness, he will establish his own laws,
                        demand universal obedience, and cause wickedness and misuse to cease.
                        He will issue his commands, and they must be obeyed; and if the nations
                        of the earth observe not his laws, "they will have no rain." And they
                        will be taught by more forcible means than moral suasion, that they are
                        dependant upon God; for the Lord will demand obedience, and the
                        Scriptures say, time and again, that the wicked shall be rooted out of
                        the land, and the righteous and the meek shall inherit the earth. The
                        Lord, after trying man's rule for thousands of years, now takes the
                        reins of government into his own hands, and makes use of the only
                        possible means of asserting his rights. For if the wicked never were
                        cut off, the righteous never could rule; and if the Devil was still
                        suffered to bear rule, God could not, at the same time; consequently
                        after long delay, he whose right it is, takes possession of the
                        kingdom; and the kingdom; and the greatness of the kingdom under the
                        rule of the whole heavens, shall be given to the Saints of the Most
                        High God; and the world will assume that position for which it was
                        made. A King shall rule in righteousness, and Princes shall decree
                        judgment. The knowledge of the Lord will spread, and extend under the
                        auspices of this government. Guided by his counsels, and under his
                        direction, all those purposes designed of Him, from the commencement,
                        in relation to both living and dead, will be in a fair way for the
                        accomplishment. (<em>The Government of God</em>, Ch.11)</font></big></big></p>
