                        listening to this message are probably saying, "But what about me?" We
                        know that many worthy and wonderful Latter-day Saints currently lack
                        the ideal opportunities and essential requirements for their progress.
                        Singleness, childlessness, death, and divorce frustrate ideals and
                        postpone the fulfillment of promised blessings. In addition, some women
                        who desire to be full-time mothers and homemakers have been literally
                        compelled to enter the full-time work force. But these frustrations are
                        only temporary. The Lord has promised that in the eternities no
                        blessing will be denied his sons and daughters who keep the
                        commandments, are true to their covenants, and desire what is right.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Many of the
                        most important deprivations of mortality will be set right in the
                        Millennium, which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in
                        the great plan of happiness for all of our Father's worthy children. We
                        know that will be true of temple ordinances. I believe it will also be
                        true of family relationships and experiences. <small>("The Great Plan
                            of Happiness," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1993, p. 75)</small></font></big></big></p>

                        that is powerful to lift us from discouragement is that the work of The
                        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, "to bring to pass the &#8230;
                        eternal life of man" (Moses 1:39), is an eternal work. Not all problems
                        are overcome and not all needed relationships are fixed in mortality.
                        The work of salvation goes on beyond the veil of death, and we should
                        not be too apprehensive about incompleteness within the limits of
                        mortality. <small>("Powerful Ideas," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov. 1995, p.
