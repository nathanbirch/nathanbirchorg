                        Millennium, when the Kingdom of God is established on the earth in
                        power, glory and perfection, and the reign of wickedness that has so
                        long prevailed is subdued, the Saints of God will have the privilege of
                        building their temples, and of entering into them, becoming, as it
                        were, pillars in the temples of God, and they will officiate for their
                        dead. Then we will see our friends come up, and perhaps some that we
                        have been acquainted with here. If we ask who will stand at the head of
                        the resurrection in this last dispensation, the answer is - Joseph
                        Smith, Junior, the Prophet of God. He is the man who will be
                        resurrected and receive the keys of the resurrection, and he will seal
                        this authority upon others, and they will hunt up their friends and
                        resurrect them when they shall have been officiated for, and bring them
                        up. And we will have revelations to know our forefathers clear back to
                        Father Adam and Mother Eve, and we will enter into the temples of God
                        and officiate for them. Then man will be sealed to man until the chain
                        is made perfect back to Adam, so that there will be a perfect chain of
                        Priesthood from Adam to the winding-up scene. This will be the work of
                        the Latter-day Saints in the Millennium. <small>(<em>Discourses of

                        frequently told you, that is the work of the Millennium. It is the work
                        that has to be performed by the seed of Abraham, the chosen seed, the
                        royal seed, the blessed of the Lord, those the Lord made covenants
                        with. They will step forth, and save every son and daughter of Adam who
                        will receive salvation here on the earth; and all the spirits in the
                        spirit world will be preached to, conversed with, and the principles of
                        salvation carried to them, that they may have the privilege of
                        receiving the Gospel; and they will have plenty of children here on the
                        earth to officiate for them in those ordinances of the Gospel that
                        pertain to the flesh. <small>(<em>Discourses of Brigham Young</em>,

                        without the Priesthood, and without the opportunities that we enjoy. We
                        shall go forth in the name of Israel's God and attend to the ordinances
                        for them. And through the Millennium, the thousand years that the
                        people will love and serve God, we will build temples and officiate
                        therein for those who have slept for hundreds and thousands of years --
                        those who would have received the truth if they had had the
                        opportunity; and we will bring them up, and form the chain entire, back

                        the names of the dead which we are unable to obtain through our
                        research, and thus every soul that is entitled to these blessings shall
                        be ferreted out and his work done for him. I fully believe that many
                        among the dead, those who are worthy, are even now engaged in compiling
                        records and arranging information, if it has not already been done, for
                        this very purpose. Why should they not be so engaged? <small>(<em>Doctrines

                        are joined together, from generation to generation, back to the time of
                        our first parents, Adam and Eve. This will not all be done before the
                        coming of our Lord, but the great work of the millennium will be the
                        temple ordinances for the dead who are worthy to receive it. <small>(<em>Doctrines

                        saving the dead has practically been reserved for the dispensation of
                        the fulness of times, when the Lord shall restore all things. It is,
                        therefore, the duty of the Latter-day Saints to see that it is
                        accomplished. We cannot do it all at once, but will have the 1,000
                        years of the millennium to do it in. In that time the work must be done
                        in behalf of the dead of the previous 6,000 years, for all who need it.
                        Temples will be built for this purpose, and the labor in them will
                        occupy most of the time of the saints. </font></big></big></p>

                        Christ comes we are expected to have done all that is within our power
                        to do now for our dead. That does not mean we are going to do all that
                        is to be done, because it will go on during the millennium. The great
                        work of the millennium will be the salvation of the dead, and those who
                        are on the other side will help us, too, by bringing us information.
                        The ordinances for the salvation of the dead are mortal ordinances,
                        because all these ordinances pertain to this life, and immortal beings
                        cannot perform them. <small>(<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, Vol.2,

                        may think that it is impossible for us to do this work for the dead
                        because we have not the names of people who lived in ancient times. We
                        have not the records, we do not know how to reach them from anything we
                        have in this life, and there have been millions of people who no doubt
                        were honest, and did the best they knew, but died without a knowledge
                        of the gospel, whose names it is impossible for us to obtain. How are
                        they going to be saved? It is our duty to go to the temple and take our
                        records and work for the dead of our own lineage as far back as we can
                        go, but what about these others? I will tell you. The great work of the
                        millennium, of 1,000 years, will be for the salvation of these souls.
                        Now let us keep it clearly in our minds that we do not enter into
                        exaltation until after the resurrection. We do not enter into
                        exaltation in the spirit world. We have privileges there, of course,
                        based upon faithfulness and obedience to the gospel, but during the
                        millennium -- and that is the great purpose of the millennium -- we
                        will go into the temples. <small>(<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>,
