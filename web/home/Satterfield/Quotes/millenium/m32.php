                        will be living here then will be in daily communication with those who
                        have passed through the resurrection, and they will come with this
                        information, this knowledge that we do not have and will give it to
                        those who are in mortality saying, "Now go into the temples and do this
                        work; when you get this done, we will bring you other names." And in
                        that way every soul who is entitled to a place in the celestial kingdom
                        of God will be ferreted out, and not one soul shall be overlooked. The
                        Lord has not overlooked these things. He has seen the end from the
                        beginning. Every name is recorded. Bless your soul, when the Lord says
                        that a sparrow cannot fall without the notice of the Father, do you
                        think he will overlook the people who lived upon this earth, who have
                        tried to the best of their ability to live righteously, but never had
                        the privilege of receiving the gospel? He will give unto them these
                        privileges of salvation and the right, through their obedience to the
                        gospel which shall come unto them, of receiving exaltation in his
                        kingdom. To think anything less than this would be an evil thought. God
                        is just. He is merciful, and while mercy cannot rob justice, yet in the
                        wisdom of our Father in heaven every soul shall receive blessings
                        according to his merits and according to the mercies of our Heavenly
                        Father, and he will do for the people the best he can. <small>(<em>Doctrines
