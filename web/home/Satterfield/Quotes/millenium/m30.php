                        some of the sealing ordinances that cannot be administered in <a

                        are now using; we can only administer in it some of the first
                        ordinances of the Priesthood pertaining to the endowment. There are
                        more advanced ordinances that cannot be administered there; we would,
                        therefore, like a temple, but I am willing to wait a few years for it.
                        I want to see the temple built in a manner that it will endure through
                        the Millennium. This is not the only temple we shall build; there will
                        be hundreds of them built and dedicated to the Lord. This temple will
                        be known as the first temple built in the mountains by the Latter-day
                        Saints. And when the Millennium is over, and all the sons and daughters
                        of Adam and Eve, down to the last of their posterity, who come within
                        the reach of the clemency of the Gospel, have been redeemed in hundreds
                        of temples through the administration of their children as proxies for
                        them, I want that temple still to stand as a proud monument of the
                        faith, perseverance and industry of the Saints of God in the mountains,
                        in the nineteenth century. <small>(<em>Discourses of Brigham Young</em>,
