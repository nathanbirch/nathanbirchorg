                            They will not probably dwell upon the earth, but will visit it when
                            they please, or when it is necessary to govern it. There will be wicked
                            men on the earth during the thousand years. The heathen nations who
                            will not come up to worship will be visited with the judgments of God,
                            and must eventually be destroyed from the earth. <small>(<em>Teachings

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">The saying
                        that there will be wicked men on the earth during the millennium has
                        been misunderstood by many, because the Lord declared that the wicked
                        shall not stand, but shall be consumed. In using this term wicked it
                        should be interpreted in the language of the Lord as recorded in the
                        Doctrine and Covenants, section 84, verses 49-53. Here the Lord speaks
                        of those who have not received the gospel as being wicked as they are
                        still under the bondage of sin, having not been baptized. The
                        inhabitants of the terrestrial order will remain on the earth during
                        the millennium, and this class is without the gospel ordinances.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">The Lord
                        said through Isaiah, speaking of the millennium: "For, behold, I create
                        new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered,
                        nor come into mind. But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I
                        create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a
                        joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people: and the
                        voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of
                        crying. There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man
                        that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years
                        old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed." <small>(<em>Doctrines
                                of Salvation</em>, 3:63-64)</small></font></big></big></p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">And yet the
                        Prophet Joseph Smith said: "There will be wicked men on the earth
                        during the thousand years. The heathen nations who will not come up to
                        worship will be visited with the judgments of God, and must eventually
                        be destroyed from the earth." (<em>Teachings</em>, pp. 268-69.) Taken
                        together, these concepts mean that wickedness that is telestial in
                        nature, wickedness that consists of living after the manner of the
                        world, that wickedness which is carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature
                        - all such shall cease. Those who so live will be destroyed. They are
                        the tares of the earth.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">But
                        wickedness is a matter of degree, and even those who are upright and
                        decent by worldly standards but who reject the gospel and do not
                        worship the true God are considered to be wicked by gospel standards.
                        They are "under the bondage of sin." They do not accept the message of
                        the restoration and gain a remission of their sins in the waters of
                        baptism. "And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked, and
                        that the whole world groaneth under sin and darkness even now."
                        (D&amp;C 84:49-53.) Thus the divine word, as given by Zechariah, says
                        that "it shall come to pass" - in the millennial day -- that every one
                        that is left [after Armageddon] of all the nations which came against
                        Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the
                        Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it shall be,
                        that who so will not come up of all the families of the earth unto
                        Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall
                        be no rain. And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that
                        have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite
                        the heathen that come not to keep the feast of tabernacles. This shall
                        be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come
                        not up to keep the feast of tabernacles." (Zech. 14:16-19.) Thus there
                        will be many churches on earth when the Millennium begins. False
                        worship will continue among those whose desires are good, "who are
                        honorable men of the earth," but who have been "blinded by the
                        craftiness of men." (D&amp;C 76:75.) Plagues will rest upon them until
                        they repent and believe the gospel or are destroyed, as the Prophet
                        said. It follows that missionary work will continue into the Millennium
                        until all who remain are converted. Then "the earth shall be full of
                        the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." (Isa. 11:9.)
                        Then every living soul on earth will belong to The Church of Jesus
                        Christ of Latter-day Saints. <small>(<em>The Millennial Messiah</em>,
