                        grandest expressions in all literature is the sweet yet awesome account
                        Jesus gives of himself, seated on his glorious throne, in the coming
                        day of judgment. He says: "When the Son of man shall come in his glory,
                        and all the holy angels with him" -- it is the day of his glorious
                        return attended by legions of exalted beings from ages past -- "then
                        shall he sit upon the throne of his glory." The judgment is set and the
                        books are opened, as it were. "And before him shall be gathered all
                        nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd
                        divideth his sheep from the goats: And he shall set the sheep on his
                        right hand, but the goats on the left." (Matt. 25:31-33.) The standard
                        by which the assembled hosts will then be judged is whether they have
                        lived Christian lives; whether they have ministered to the needs of
                        their fellowmen; whether they have fed the hungry, clothed the naked,
                        and visited the sick and imprisoned. It will be whether they have lived
                        the laws revealed by him who is the Judge. <small>(<em>The Millennial
