                        endowment work of the temple along with mortal beings? The answer to
                        this question is no! That is, they will not assist in performing the
                        ordinances. Resurrected beings will assist in furnishing information
                        which is not otherwise available, but mortals will have to do the
                        ordinance work in the temples.</font></big></big></p>

                        confirmation, ordination, endowment, and sealings all pertain to this
                        mortal life and are ordinances required of those who are in mortality.
                        Provision has been made for these ordinances to be performed
                        vicariously for those who are worthy but who died without the
                        opportunity in this life of receiving these ordinances in person.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">You can
                        readily see that it would be inconsistent for a resurrected being to
                        come and be baptized for the dead. The resurrected person has passed to
                        another sphere where the laws and blessings do not pertain to this
                        mortal life. This is equally true of every other ordinance. If it were
                        permissible for resurrected persons to come and do work in the temples,
                        then there would be no reason for us in this mortal life to act
                        vicariously for them, for they would do it for themselves.<small> (<em>Doctrines
