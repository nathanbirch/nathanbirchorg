                        destruction of the wicked among the Nephites was necessary in order to
                        bring about a reign of peace and righteousness for three or four
                        generations, do you not think that there will have to be great and
                        overwhelming destructions to cleanse the earth of the wicked and to lay
                        the foundation of a thousand years of peace and righteousness? Will
                        wickedness be allowed to flourish? I tell you, no.</font></big></big></p>

                        from the wicked as great in its place as the cleansing of the earth by
                        the flood that came in the days of Noah, though this time it will be by
                        fire. Malachi says the day will come when the wicked shall be ashes

                        I have said, you can see the operation of this cleansing process among
                        us. The wicked are gradually being purged from among us. It is not very
                        perceptible; we have got to think about it and call it to mind to
                        become aware of it; but we can become aware of it if we will reflect.
                        And this will be more and more the case as the power of God increases
                        and the responsibility of the Latter-day Saints becomes greater.</font></big></big></p>

                        pass away to be renewed again a celestial globe, but it will be the end
                        of unrighteousness. 'All who have lived the telestial law -- that is
                        those who are unclean, "they who are liars, and sorcerers, and
                        whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie" and who suffer the

                        shall be swept off from the face of the earth. All of these will be
                        cast down to hell where they shall remain until Christ shall have
                        subdued all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work.
                        During the thousand years all of these will be in this torment of mind,
                        having ample time to reflect over their misdeeds and receive training
                        in obedience to law, so that they may be prepared to come forth in the

                        impossible for the people of this class to remain on the earth during
                        the Millennium, for they would be as much out of their element as a
                        fish out of water. The changed condition of the earth, which will be of
                        a terrestrial order during this thousand years, will be suited to the
                        capacity of those of the terrestrial world as well as those who have
                        kept the celestial law, and they shall have part in the first
                        resurrection. "And then shall the heathen nations be redeemed, and they
                        that knew no law shall have part in the first resurrection, "And it
                        shall be tolerable for them." (D.C. 45:54.) But with those of the

                        who shall be consumed when Christ comes, according to the words of
                        Malachi. (4:1.) It is of this class the Lord speaks when he says:</font></big></big></p>

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Enoch sought
                        to learn from the Lord when the curse would be removed and when the
                        earth would be blessed again. After he and his city had been
                        translated, "Enoch looked upon the earth; and he heard a voice from the
                        bowels thereof, saying: Wo, wo is me, the mother of men; I am pained, I
                        am weary, because of the wickedness of my children. When shall I rest,
                        and be cleansed from the filthiness which is gone forth out of me? When
                        will my Creator sanctify me, that I may rest, and righteousness for a
                        season abide upon my face?" How graphic and wondrous is this way of
                        teaching -- to let the very earth itself cry out for rest and
                        blessings! "And when Enoch heard the earth mourn, he wept, and cried
                        unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, wilt thou not have compassion upon the
                        earth? Wilt thou not bless the children of Noah?" And the Lord did then
                        bless the earth to this extent: he decreed that life on its face should
                        never again be destroyed by a flood. But the basic questions remained
                        unanswered, and so Enoch yet "cried unto the Lord, saying: When the Son
                        of Man cometh in the flesh, shall the earth rest? I pray thee, show me
                        these things." He then saw the crucifixion, the convulsions of nature
                        that attended it, the opening of the prison doors, and the reserving of
                        the wicked "in chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day.
                        And again Enoch wept and cried unto the Lord, saying: When shall the
                        earth rest? And Enoch beheld the Son of Man ascend up unto the Father;
                        and he called unto the Lord, saying: Wilt thou not come again upon the
                        earth?</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">I ask thee
                        if thou wilt not come again on the earth." How great were the pleadings
                        of this holy prophet to know what would be in the last days!</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">"And the
                        Lord said unto Enoch: As I live, so will I come in the last days, in
                        the days of wickedness and vengeance. . . . And the day shall come that
                        the earth shall rest, but before that day the heavens shall be
                        darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth; and the heavens
                        shall shake, and also the earth; and great tribulations shall be among
                        the children of men, but my people will I preserve." Then the Lord told
                        Enoch of the restoration of the gospel, the coming forth of the Book of
                        Mormon, the building of the New Jerusalem, and the return of the
                        original Zion, and gave him the promise that "for the space of a
                        thousand years the earth shall rest. And it came to pass that Enoch saw
                        the day of the coming of the Son of Man, in the last days, to dwell on
                        the earth in righteousness for the space of a thousand years." (Moses

                        Lord will come at the appointed time. The great conference at
                        Adam-ondi-Ahman will assemble to worship the King on schedule. There
                        will be an exact moment when his foot first touches the Mount of
                        Olives. He will stand on Mount Zion with the 144,000 high priests at a
                        given point in time. Armageddon will spread its fire and horror and
                        death when and as decreed in the divine timetable. The tares will be
                        burned and the vineyard cleansed of corruption when the Lord Jesus
                        returns. And there will be a day and an hour and a split second that
                        marks the beginning of the Millennium. The seventh of the thousand-year
                        periods can only commence at one single instant in tame. As we have
                        seen, many of the events incident to the Second Coming will take place
                        during the close of the sixth seal and others after the opening of the
                        seventh seal. And yet the formal beginning of the Millennium will take
                        place at a fixed and determined and set moment. It cannot be hastened
                        by righteousness nor delayed by wickedness. The old earth will die, and
                        the new heaven and the new earth will be born at as exact an instant as
                        is the case with the birth or death of any form of life. We speak thus
                        so there will be no confusion or misunderstanding when we also say that
                        the full glory and wonder of the millennial day will unfold gradually;
                        that there will be wicked men on earth after the Millennium has
                        commenced; and that the final glory and triumph of Israel will take
                        place gradually after the Millennium itself has been ushered in. Let us
                        now see what the holy word has to say relative to these things.</font></big></big></p>

                        inhabitant." (Isa. 5:9.) Those sent to raise the warning voice to the

                        the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord
                        have removed men far away." (Isa. 6:11-12.) In the day of the Lord's
                        coming, "the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for
                        a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one
                        day; and shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
                        field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard bearer
                        fainteth. And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
                        child may write them." (Isa. 10:17-19.) "Behold, the Lord maketh the
                        earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and
                        scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. . . . The land shall be
                        utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled. . . . Therefore hath the curse
                        devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore
                        the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left." (Isa.
                        24:1-6.) Who can doubt that there will be but few men left at the
                        beginning of the Millennium?</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">The
                        prophetic word that sets forth what is to be during the Millennium
                        speaks of "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
                        righteousness." (2 Pet. 3:13.) It says that every corruptible thing
                        shall be consumed when the vineyard is burned. And yet the Prophet
                        Joseph Smith said: "There will be wicked men on the earth during the
                        thousand years. The heathen nations who will not come up to worship
                        will be visited with the judgments of God, and must eventually be
                        destroyed from the earth." (<em>Teachings</em>, pp. 268-69.) Taken
                        together, these concepts mean that wickedness that is telestial in
                        nature, wickedness that consists of living after the manner of the
                        world, that wickedness which is carnal, sensual, and devilish by nature
                        - all such shall cease. Those who so live will be destroyed. They are
                        the tares of the earth.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">But
                        wickedness is a matter of degree, and even those who are upright and
                        decent by worldly standards but who reject the gospel and do not
                        worship the true God are considered to be wicked by gospel standards.
                        They are "under the bondage of sin." They do not accept the message of
                        the restoration and gain a remission of their sins in the waters of
                        baptism. "And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked, and
                        that the whole world groaneth under sin and darkness even now."
                        (D&amp;C 84:49-53.) Thus the divine word, as given by Zechariah, says
                        that "it shall come to pass" - in the millennial day -- that every one
                        that is left [after Armageddon] of all the nations which came against
                        Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the
                        Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it shall be,
                        that who so will not come up of all the families of the earth unto
                        Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall
                        be no rain. And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that
                        have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the Lord will smite
                        the heathen that come not to keep the feast of tabernacles. This shall
                        be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come
                        not up to keep the feast of tabernacles." (Zech. 14:16-19.) Thus there
                        will be many churches on earth when the Millennium begins. False
                        worship will continue among those whose desires are good, "who are
                        honorable men of the earth," but who have been "blinded by the
                        craftiness of men." (D&amp;C 76:75.) Plagues will rest upon them until
                        they repent and believe the gospel or are destroyed, as the Prophet
                        said. It follows that missionary work will continue into the Millennium
                        until all who remain are converted. Then "the earth shall be full of
                        the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." (Isa. 11:9.)
                        Then every living soul on earth will belong to The Church of Jesus
                        Christ of Latter-day Saints. <small>(<em>The Millennial Messiah</em>,
