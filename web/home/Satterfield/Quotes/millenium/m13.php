                            habitation [i.e., the earth during the Millennium] may be compared to
                            Paradise, from whence man, in the beginning, was driven.When Adam was
                            driven from the Garden, an angel was placed with a flaming sword to
                            guard the way of the Tree of Life, lest man should eat of it, and
                            become immortal in his degenerate state, and thus be incapable of
                            obtaining that exaltation, which he would be capable of enjoying
                            through the redemption of Jesus Christ, and the power of the
                            resurrection, with his renewed and glorified body. Having tasted of the
                            nature of the fall, and having grappled with sin and misery, knowing,
                            like the gods, both good and evil; having like Jesus overcome the evil,
                            and through the power of atonement, having conquered death, hell, and
                            the grave, he regains that Paradise, from which he was banished, not in
                            the capacity of ignorant man, unacquainted with evil, but like unto a
                            god. He can now stretch forth, and partake of the Tree of Life, and eat
                            of its fruits, and live and flourish eternally in possession of that
                            immortality which Jesus long ago promised to the faithful: "To him that
                            overcomes, will I grant to sit with me in my throne; and eat of the
                            Tree of Life which is in the midst of the Paradise of God." <small>(<em>The

                        then the earth became a telestial world, and it is of that order today.
                        I do not mean a telestial glory such as will be found in telestial
                        worlds after their resurrection, but a telestial condition which has
                        been from the days of Adam until now and will continue until Christ

                            It will continue to go forward until every one of God's children has
                            had an opportunity to receive the gospel, to hear it and to have it
                            explained to them. And then at the end of that millennial period we
                            will all stand judgment. There is a partial judgment before, but the
                            final judgment will be at the end. Then this earth will undergo a
                            change and receive its paradisiacal glory and will be made a fit abode

                        approaching the day when there will be a new heaven and a new earth. By
                        earth we mean this planet, this orb, this abiding place for mortal men;
                        we mean the lands and the seas, the ground whereon we walk, and the
                        pleasant valleys and towering mountains; we mean the great rivers and
                        small streams, the Edenic gardens and the desert waste lands; we mean
                        all of the places where the soles of our feet have trod. By heaven we
                        mean the atmospheric heavens, the layers of air and moisture that
                        surround the earth, the clouds of heaven and the free-moving breezes;
                        we mean the life-giving breath that is breathed into the nostrils of
                        living creatures; we mean the blue skies and the rainbow-hued panoramas
                        of color that attend the rising and setting sun. And when we say the
                        heavens and the earth shall be made new, we have in mind changes so
                        dramatic and alterations of such giant proportion that things as they
                        are now will scarcely be remembered or brought to mind. . . .</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">"We believe"
                        - it is an official, a formal, a canonized pronouncement - "that the
                        earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." (A of F 10.)
                        All things when first created - the earth and all forms of life -- were
                        paradisiacal in nature and were pronounced by their Creator as "very
                        good." (Moses 2:31.) There was no sin, no sorrow, and no death in that
                        day. And the Great Creator blessed the earth and all things on its
                        face. Then came the fall, and the earth which God had blessed was
                        cursed. "Cursed shall be the ground for thy sake," he said to Adam; "in
                        sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns also, and
                        thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of
                        the field." (Moses 4:23-24.) To Cain the Lord said: "When thou tillest
                        the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength."
                        (Moses 5:37.) And later, with reference to all men, the divine account
                        says: "And God cursed the earth with a sore curse, and was angry with
                        the wicked, with all the sons of men whom he had made." (Moses 5:56.)
                        That curse now prevails; it is in full operation, and it will continue
                        so to be until the millennial day. Then the earth and all things that
                        remain after the day of burning will return to a paradisiacal state, a
                        state in which all things will be blessed and prospered as they were in
                        the primeval day. A thing cannot be renewed unless it was new in the
                        first instance. The earth was paradisiacal once, and it will become so
                        again. <small>(<em>The Millennial Messiah</em>, pp.613-616)</small></font></big></big></p>
