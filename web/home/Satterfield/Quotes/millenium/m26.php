                        the Spirit of God can enlighten man's minds. Standing on this platform,
                        we view all things of a political and religious nature associated with
                        the earth we are living on as being very uncertain, intangible, and
                        unphilosophical. We expect to see the nations waste, crumble, and
                        decay. We expect to see a universal chaos of religious and political
                        sentiment, and an uncertainty much more serious than anything that
                        exists at the present time. We look forward to the time, and try to
                        help it on, when God will assert his own right with regard to the
                        government of the earth; when, as in religious matters so in political
                        matters, he will enlighten the minds of those that bear rule, he will
                        teach the kings wisdom and instruct the senators by the Spirit of
                        eternal truth; when to him "every knee shall bow and every tongue
                        confess that Jesus is the Christ." Then "the earth shall, be full of
                        the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. (Isaiah 11:9.)
                        Then shall the mists of darkness be swept away by the light of eternal
                        truth. Then will the intelligence of heaven beam forth on the human
                        mind, and by it they will comprehend everything that is great, and
                        good, and glorious. <small>(<em>The Gospel Kingdom</em>, p.348)</small></font></big></big></p>

                        Joseph and his children and that on this land the City Zion, or New
                        Jerusalem, is to be built. He also learned that Jerusalem in Palestine

                        land of Zion and one in Palestine, are to become capitals for the

                        the house of the Lord in these valleys of the mountains. Here they are

                        scattered remnants who there assemble, becomes to them as a New

                        Thus Jesus, continuing his preaching to the Nephites, said: "And

                        builds the New Jerusalem, the Lord will come and dwell with his people.</font></big></big></p>

                        Gentiles, because they are not nationals of the kingdom of Judah (the

                        be called the New Jerusalem." Israel - all gathered remnants assisting
                        each other - shall build the New Jerusalem in America.</font></big></big></p>
