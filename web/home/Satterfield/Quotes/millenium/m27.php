                            They will not probably dwell upon the earth, but will visit it when
                            they please, or when it is necessary to govern it. There will be wicked
                            men on the earth during the thousand years. The heathen nations who
                            will not come up to worship will be visited with the judgments of God,
                            and must eventually be destroyed from the earth. <small>(<em>Teachings

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">When Christ
                        comes, he will set up a political kingdom which will include all the
                        inhabitants of the earth, no matter what nation they may belong to or
                        what may be their religious faith. The Lord gave to man his free agency
                        in the pre-existence. This great gift of agency, that is the privilege
                        given to man to make his own choice, has never been revoked, and it
                        never will be. It is an eternal principle giving freedom of thought and
                        action to every soul. No person, by any decree of the Father, has ever
                        been compelled to do good; no person has ever been forced to do evil.
                        Each may act for himself. It was Satan's plan to destroy this agency
                        and force men to do his will. There could be no satisfactory existence
                        without this great gift. Men must have the privilege to choose even to
                        the extent that they may rebel against the divine decrees. Of course
                        salvation and exaltation must come through the free will without
                        coercion and by individual merit in order that righteous rewards may be
                        given and proper punishment be meted out to the transgressor.
                        Therefore, when the great day of the Lord shall come, the wicked who
                        have merited banishment from a righteous government will be consumed,
                        or the privilege of continuance on the earth will be denied. </font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Therefore,
                        according to the justice of the Lord, all who have not violated the
                        right to remain will not be consumed. We are informed that these,
                        although they may not be members of the Church, who are entitled to the
                        blessings of the terrestrial kingdom, will be spared. Therefore, there
                        will be millions of people on the earth during the millennium who have
                        not received the gospel. Missionary work will continue with greater
                        vigor and power than at any other time. This work must go on until all
                        who are on the earth are either converted or are taken away by death.<small>
