                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">We have the
                        fulness of the everlasting gospel, meaning that we have all that is
                        needed to gain the fulness of salvation. We have every truth, doctrine,
                        and principle, every rite, power, and ordinance -- all that is needed
                        -- to gain exaltation in the highest heaven of the celestial world. But
                        we do not know all things; there are doctrines in endless array of
                        which we know next to nothing; indeed, there are more things in the
                        darkness of the unknown than there are in the light of the known. We do
                        not even know what the faithful knew in Enoch's Zion, nor among the
                        Nephites when they dwelt in righteousness for generations. We do not
                        know what is on the sealed portion of the plates from which the Book of
                        Mormon came. Ours is a day for drinking milk; the day when we, as a
                        people at least, can partake of the meat of the word is in the future.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">That future
                        is millennial. In that day, "all things shall become new," saith the
                        Lord, "that my knowledge and glory may dwell upon all the earth. . . .
                        Yea, verily I say unto you, in that day when the Lord shall come, he
                        shall reveal all things -- Things which have passed, and hidden things
                        which no man knew, things of the earth, by which it was made, and the
                        purpose and the end thereof -- Things most precious, things that are
                        above, and things that are beneath, things that are in the earth, and
                        upon the earth, and in heaven." (D&amp;C 101:25, 32-34.) As we ponder
                        these heaven-sent words, we are led to exclaim: Thanks be to him who is
                        the Way, the Truth, and the Life, who knows all things and who seeks to
                        pour out his revelations, and all the knowledge of eternity, upon all
                        who will receive them. Ere long the dark veil of ignorance and unbelief
                        that covers the earth and blinds the minds of men shall be pierced.
                        Light and truth will fall from heaven as does rain from the clouds
                        above.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">The
                        knowledge of God, the knowledge of those Gods whom it is life eternal
                        to know, shall be in every heart. No longer will theologians suppose
                        that God is a spirit essence that fills immensity while he dwells in
                        the human heart. No longer will philosophers pontificate about some
                        great first cause that inexplicably brought order into a chaotic
                        universe. No longer will Babylonish churches place crucifixes in the
                        hands, or the images of Diana of the Ephesians, as it were, and no
                        longer will they worship the works of their own hands in the great
                        cathedrals of Christendom. The knowledge of God, the truth about God,
                        the fact that he is a Holy Man, will come by revelation into every
                        human heart. The knowledge of God will cover the earth.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">All things
                        are to be revealed in the millennial day. The sealed part of the Book
                        of Mormon will come forth; the brass plates will be translated; the
                        writings of Adam and Enoch and Noah and Abraham and prophets without
                        number will be revealed. We shall learn a thousand times more about the
                        earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus than we now know. We shall learn
                        great mysteries of the kingdom that were not even known to those of old
                        who walked and talked with the Eternal One. We shall learn the details
                        of the creation and the origin of man and what fools mortals are to
                        follow the fads of the evolving evolutionary nonsense that litters the
                        textbooks of academia. Nothing in or on or over the earth will be
                        withheld from human ken, for eventually man, if he is to be as his
                        Maker, must know all things.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Hear in this
                        connection these words of Nephi: In that day, "the earth shall be full
                        of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. Wherefore,
                        the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be
                        made known unto the children of men. There is nothing which is secret
                        save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall
                        be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed
                        upon the earth save it shall be loosed. Wherefore, all things which
                        have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be
                        revealed." (2 Ne. 30:15-18.) Surely man could not ask for more than
                        this in the way of light and truth and knowledge, and yet expect to
                        remain in the flesh as a mortal and be in process of working out his
                        salvation. Surely this is the day in which the Lord shall fulfill the
                        promise of holy writ that says: "God shall give unto you knowledge by
                        his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost,
                        [knowledge] that has not been revealed since the world was until now;
                        which our forefathers have awaited with anxious expectation to be
                        revealed in the last times, which their minds were pointed to by the
                        angels, as held in reserve for the fulness of their glory; a time to
                        come in the which nothing shall be withheld, whether there be one God
                        or many gods, they shall be manifest." (D&amp;C 121:26-28.) That this
                        outpouring of divine goodness has already commenced is not open to
                        question. That it will continue, in far greater measure, after our Lord
                        comes again, who can doubt? <small>(<em>The Millennial Messiah</em>,
