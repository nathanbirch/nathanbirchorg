                        Savior comes, the earth will be changed to a terrestrial condition and
                        will then be made the fit abode for terrestrial beings, and this
                        condition will last until after the close of the millennium when the
                        earth will die and be raised again in a resurrection to receive its
                        glory as a celestial body, which is its final state. We are living in
                        the great day of restoration. The Lord has declared that all things are
                        to be restored to their primitive condition. Our Tenth Article of Faith
                        says, "We believe . . . that Christ will reign personally upon the
                        earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal
                        glory." Too many have the idea that this has reference to the
                        celestialized earth, but this is not the case. It refers to the
                        restored earth as it will be when Christ comes to reign. This is taught
                        in Isaiah 65:17-25, and in the Doctrine and Covenants, section
                        101:23-31. <small>(<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, 1:85)</small></font></big></big><br

                        past this earth had a paradisiacal glory, and then came the fall,
                        bringing a change, and that change has been upon the earth in the
                        neighborhood of 6,000 years. What is meant by the restoration of the
                        earth? This earth is to be renewed and brought back to the condition in
                        which it was before it was cursed through the fall of Adam. When Adam
                        passed out of the Garden of Eden, then the earth became a telestial
                        world, and it is of that order today. I do not mean a telestial glory
                        such as will be found in telestial worlds after their resurrection, but
                        a telestial condition which has been from the days of Adam until now
                        and will continue until Christ comes.<small> (<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>,
