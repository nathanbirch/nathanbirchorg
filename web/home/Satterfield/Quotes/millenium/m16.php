                        men." (D&amp;C 45:55.) As they live the gospel of Jesus Christ, the
                        righteousness of the people will banish Satan from their midst. We look
                        forward to that day of universal peace and justice, when Christ will
                        reign upon the earth. <small>("Peace Within," <em>Ensign</em>, May

                        about Satan being bound. Satan will be bound by the power of God; but
                        he will be bound also by the determination of the people of God not to
                        listen to him, not to be governed by him. The Lord will not bind him
                        and take his power from the earth while there are men and women willing
                        to be governed by him. That is contrary to the plan of salvation. To
                        deprive men of their agency is contrary to the purposes of our God.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">There was a
                        time on this continent, of which we have an account, when the people
                        were so righteous that Satan did not have power among them. Nearly four
                        generations passed away in righteousness. They lived in purity and died
                        without sin. That was through their refusal to yield to Satan. It is
                        not recorded that Satan had no power in other parts of the earth during
                        that period. According to all history that we have in our possession
                        Satan had the same power over men who were willing to listen to him.
                        But in this land he did not have power, and he was literally bound. I
                        believe that this will be the case in the Millennium. <small>(Conference

                            Satan only gains power over man through man's exercise of his own
                            agency; and when Satan shall be bound, as the Lord says he will be for
                            a thousand years, one of the great powers that will help bring this to
                            pass will be man's agency. The Lord has never forced men against their
                            will to obey Him. He never will do so. If Satan, therefore, has power
                            with man, it is because man yields to his influence.</font></big></big></div>

                        which takes this course helps bring to pass the fulfillment of the
                        words of the Lord concerning the binding of Satan. <small>(<em>Gospel

                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">My view of
                        the Gospel is that when it is obeyed by mankind the power of the devil
                        will cease. That is my view respecting a part of the power that will be
                        brought to bear to bind Satan. Satan will be bound because he will not
                        have power over the hearts of the children of men. Why? One reason will
                        be because they will have obeyed the more perfect law which will have
                        relieved them from his power&#8230;.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">In the
                        Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as God has revealed it unto us there
                        are laws so perfect that when this people called Latter-day Saints
                        shall obey them they will be so far lifted up above the power of Satan
                        that he will have but little power to tempt them. We never shall be
                        emancipated from the power of Satan until we do obey these laws of God.
                        An obedience thereto will bring emancipation to us and to every human
                        being on the face of the earth, and it is upon no other principle that
                        emancipation can be brought.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">It will not
                        be as many suppose by our being withdrawn without volition on our part
                        from the influences of Satan; but it will be by our obedience to the
                        laws of God, by our conforming to the requirements which He makes of
                        us, by our putting into practice all those higher laws which God has
                        revealed and which He designs we shall practice. Any soul that is
                        waiting for some outward deliverance, waiting for some time to come
                        when by some extraneous means and independent of our action and the
                        exercise of our agency deliverance will be brought, will wait in vain,
                        I am afraid.</font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">Not that I
                        would convey the idea that God is not going to help us, that God is not
                        going to do it by His power; I would not convey any such idea because I
                        know and you know that without God's help all our efforts are
                        powerless, and it is vain to seek to do anything in and of ourselves;
                        we cannot do it. Human nature is too fallible to do anything of this
                        kind; but we must exercise the powers God has given to us by obeying
                        His law, by conforming to His requirements.</font></big></big></p>

                        we will be emancipated through the blessing and aid of God upon us, and
                        in this way the earth will be redeemed from the power of Satan. The
                        more people obey the laws of God as God has revealed them and as they
                        are embodied in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the nearer they approach
                        unto God, the more they become like Him, the more power they get over
                        themselves and over the adversary. <small>(<em>Gospel Truth</em>,
