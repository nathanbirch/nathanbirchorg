                    exalted
                    himself in his heart, and received not counsel, but grieved the Spirit;

                    not,
                    behold he standeth no longer in the office to which I have appointed

                    to be judged, and are found under condemnation;

                    neither

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>102 And another
                    trump shall sound,
                    which is the fourth trump, saying: There are found among those who are
                    to remain until that great and last day, even the end, who shall remain
                    filthy still.

                    trump shall sound,
                    which is the fifth trump, which is the fifth angel who committeth the
                    everlasting
                    gospel--flying through the midst of heaven, unto all nations, kindreds,

                </big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>104 And this
                    shall be the sound of
                    his trump, saying to all people, both in heaven and in earth, and that
                    are under the earth--for every ear shall hear it, and every knee shall
                    bow, and every tongue shall confess, while they hear the sound of the
                    trump,
                    saying: Fear God, and give glory to him who sitteth upon the throne,
                    forever
                    and ever; for the hour of his judgment is come.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>105 And again,
                    another angel shall
                    sound his trump, which is the sixth angel, saying: She is fallen who
                    made
                    all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; she is
                    fallen,
                    is fallen!
                </big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>106 And again,
                    another angel shall
                    sound his trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is finished; it
                    is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press
                    alone,
                    even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.
                </big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>107 And then
                    shall the angels be
                    crowned with the glory of his might, and the saints shall be filled
                    with
                    his glory, and receive their inheritance and be made equal with him.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>108 And then
                    shall the first angel
                    again sound his trump in the ears of all living, and reveal the secret
                    acts of men, and the mighty works of God in the first thousand years.
                </big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>109 And then
                    shall the second angel

                    until the seventh
                    angel shall sound his trump; and he shall stand forth upon the land and
                    upon the sea, and swear in the name of him who sitteth upon the throne,
                    that there shall be time no longer; and Satan shall be bound, that old
                    serpent, who is called the devil, and shall not be loosed for the space
                    of a thousand years.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>111 And then he
                    shall be loosed for
                    a little season, that he may gather together his armies.
                </big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>112 And Michael,
                    the seventh angel,
                    even the archangel, shall gather together his armies, even the hosts of
                    heaven.
                </big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>113 And the
                    devil shall gather together

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>114 And then
                    cometh the battle of

                    their
                    own place, that they shall not have power over the saints any more at
                    all.

                <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big>115 For Michael
                    shall fight their

                    sitteth
