                        will be taught far more intensely and with greater power during the

                        Satan shall be bound so that he cannot tempt any man. Should any man
                        refuse to repent and accept the gospel under those conditions then he
                        would be accursed. Through the revelations given to the prophets, we
                        learn that during the reign of Jesus Christ for a thousand years
                        eventually all people will embrace the truth.</font></big></big></p>

                        calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child
                        shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones
                        shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And
                        the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned
                        child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. They shall not hurt
                        nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the
                        knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."</font></big></big></p>

                        in Isaiah, Moroni quoted to the Prophet Joseph Smith and said to him it

                        earth as the waters do the sea, then it must be universally received.
