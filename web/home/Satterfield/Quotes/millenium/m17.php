                        will Satan be bound during the Millennium? It will be by the
                        righteousness of the people. Thus Nephi says: "The time cometh speedily
                        that Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of
                        men; for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do
                        wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must be
                        burned." The destruction of the wicked sets the stage for millennial
                        righteousness. When the wicked are burned, those who are left will not
                        be susceptible to the promptings from beneath. "And the time cometh
                        speedily that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and
                        the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power,
                        and great glory." During the Millennium, when the Lord reigns, children
                        will grow up in an environment of righteousness. No longer will the
                        calves of Abraham's herds and the lambs of Jacob's flocks be lost in
                        the deserts of sin; no longer will they forage for food by the wayside
                        and drink water from stagnant pools; no longer will they be pulled down
                        by the evils and designs of conspiring men. In the millennial day, in
                        the household of faith, children will be brought up in the nurture and
                        admonition of the Lord, as calves in the stall, as lambs in the
                        sheepcote. </font></big></big></p>
                <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><font face="Arial">And in that
                        day, the Holy One of Israel "gathereth his children from the four
                        quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him;
                        and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his
                        sheep, and in him they shall find pasture." It is, then, in this
                        blessed millennial setting that the great proclamation about the
                        binding of Satan is made. "And because of the righteousness of his
                        people, Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the
                        space of many years; for he hath no power over the hearts of the
                        people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel
                        reigneth." (1 Ne. 22:15, 24-26.) Thus Satan is bound because he "shall
                        have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long
                        time." (2 Ne. 30:18.) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus
                            the probationary nature of man's second estate is preserved even during
                            the Millennium</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
                            not that men cannot sin, for the power is in them to do so - they have
                            their agency -- but it is that they do not sin because Satan is subject
                            to them, and they are not enticed by his evil whisperings</span>. <small>(<em>The
