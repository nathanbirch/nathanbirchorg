                        some of the glories to attend the resurrection of the just. And the
                        company of the righteous will include all who have lived faithfully
                        according to the laws of God as made known to them; children who have
                        died in their innocence; and even the just among the heathen nations
                        who have lived in comparative darkness while groping for light, and who
                        have died in ignorance. This doctrine is made plain by modern
                        revelation: "And then shall the heathen nations be redeemed, and they
                        that knew no law shall have part in the first resurrection." The
                        Millennium then is to be inaugurated by a glorious deliverance of the
                        just from the power of death; and of this company of the redeemed it is
                        written: "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
                        resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be
                        priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand

                        was a general resurrection of the righteous at the time Christ arose
                        from the dead, it is customary for us to speak of the resurrection of
                        the righteous at the Second Coming of Christ as the first resurrection.
                        It is the first to us, for we have little thought or concern over that
                        which is past. The Lord has promised that at the time of his Second
                        Advent the graves will be opened, and the just shall come forth to
                        reign with him on the earth for a thousand years. <small>(<em>Doctrines

                        have already come forth from the grave in their resurrected and

                        the day of Christ were with him in his resurrection. (Matt. 27:52-53;
                        D. &amp; C. 133:54-55; Hela. 14:25.) To us, however, the first
                        resurrection, the resurrection of the just, will come with the return
                        of our Lord and the commencement of his millennial reign.</font></big></big></p>
