                        generation shall have my word through you" (D&amp;C 5:10). Joseph Smith
                        has given the word, and we echo the message, and a great part of the
                        message is that every one of us - equally precious - has power to get
                        in tune with the Holy Spirit and learn personally what the prophet
                        receives. There is going to be a day - it is millennial, the ancient
                        prophets (Jeremiah, for one) foretold it - "when no man need say to his
                        neighbor, Know ye the Lord; for all shall know Him &#8230; from the least to
                        the greatest" (<em>History of the Church</em>, 3:380). The Prophet
                        Joseph Smith said that this promise has reference to personal
                        revelation, to a visitation of the Lord to an individual (see <em>History
                            of the Church</em>, 3:381). <small>["This Generation Shall Have My
                            Word through You," <em>Ensign</em>, June 1980, p. 59]</small></font></big></big><br

                        know God in the millennial day because they see him. He will teach them
                        face to face. They will know the mysteries of his kingdom because they
                        are caught up to the third heaven, as was Paul. They will receive the
                        Second Comforter. The millennial day is the day of the Second
                        Comforter, and whereas but few have been blessed with this divine
                        association in times past, great hosts will be so blessed in times to
                        come.</font></big></big></p>

                        will be the nature of worship during the Millennium? It will be pure
                        and perfect, and through it men will become inheritors of eternal life.
                        And in this connection, be it known that it is the privilege of the
                        saints today to separate themselves from the world and to receive
                        millennial blessings in their lives. And any person who today abides
                        the laws that will be kept during the Millennium will receive, here and
                        now, the spirit and blessings of the Millennium in his life, even
                        though he is surrounded by a world of sin and evil. And so we say, in
                        the language of Joseph Smith as he finished the record of the vision of
                        the three degrees of glory: "Great and marvelous are the works of the
                        Lord, and the mysteries of his kingdom which he showed unto us, which
                        surpass all understanding in glory, and in might, and in dominion;
                        Which he commanded us we should not write while we were yet in the
                        Spirit, and are not lawful for man to utter; Neither is man capable to
                        make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood by the
                        power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who love him, and
                        purify themselves before him; To whom he grants this privilege of
                        seeing and knowing for themselves; That through the power and
                        manifestation of the Spirit, while in the flesh, they may be able to
                        bear his presence in the world of glory. And to God and the Lamb be
                        glory, and honor, and dominion forever and ever. Amen." (D&amp;C
                        76:114-119.) <small>[<em>The Millennial Messiah</em>, p.683]</small></font></big></big></p>
