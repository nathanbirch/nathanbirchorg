                                &#8220;The word &#8216;angel&#8217;
                                is used in the scriptures for any heavenly being bearing God&#8217;s message&#8221;
                                (George Q. Cannon, Gospel Truth, sel. Jerreld L. Newquist [1987], 54).
                                The scriptures recite numerous instances where an angel appeared
                                personally. Angelic appearances to Zacharias and Mary (see Luke 1) and
                                to King Benjamin and Nephi, the grandson of Helaman (see Mosiah 3:2; 3
                                Ne. 7:17&#8211;18) are only a few examples. When I was young, I thought such
                                personal appearances were the only meaning of the ministering of
                                angels. As a young holder of the Aaronic Priesthood, I did not think I
                                would see an angel, and I wondered what such appearances had to do with
                                the Aaronic Priesthood.</span></big></big><br

                                But the
                                ministering of angels can also be unseen. Angelic messages can be
                                delivered by a voice or merely by thoughts or feelings communicated to
                                the mind. President John Taylor described &#8220;the action of the angels, or
                                messengers of God, upon our minds, so that the heart can conceive &#8230;

                                Nephi described
                                three manifestations of the ministering of angels when he reminded his
                                rebellious brothers that (1) they had &#8220;seen an angel,&#8221; (2) they had
                                &#8220;heard his voice from time to time,&#8221; and (3) also that an angel had
                                &#8220;spoken unto [them] in a still small voice&#8221; though they were &#8220;past
                                feeling&#8221; and &#8220;could not feel his words&#8221; (1 Ne. 17:45). The scriptures
                                contain many other statements that angels are sent to teach the gospel
                                and bring men to Christ (see Heb. 1:14; Alma 39:19; Moro. 7:25, 29,

                            ministering to those on earth, but it is rich doctrine and rich history
