                        surprising that we feel from time to time nearly overwhelmed. Your
                        thought that &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I can do this&#8221; is evidence that you are
                        understanding what it means to hold the priesthood of God. The fact is
                        that you can&#8217;t do it by yourself. The responsibility is too difficult
                        and too important for your mortal powers and for mine. Recognizing that
                        is at the foundation of great priesthood service.

                        feelings of inadequacy strike us, it is the time to remember the
                        Savior. He assures us that we don&#8217;t do this work alone. There are
                        scriptures to put on your mirror and to remember in the moments when
                        you are doubting your capacity.

                        instance, President Thomas S. Monson remembered the promised words of
                        the Savior as he blessed me six months ago to stand fearlessly in my
                        calling when it seemed hard. These words of the Savior, which He gave
                        to His tiny band of priesthood holders in this dispensation, came to
                        the prophet&#8217;s mind as he laid his hands on my head: &#8220;And whoso
                        receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I
                        will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in
                        your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.&#8221;(D&amp;C

                        which President Monson remembered and quoted was fulfilled for me.
                        Confidence replaced doubt, the Spirit came, medical helpers were
                        inspired, my life was preserved, and I was borne up. Because of that
                        blessing by President Monson, it will always be easy for me to remember
                        the Savior and trust His promise that He goes before and beside us in
                        His service.

                <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: arial;"><big><big>I
                            know that the promise of angels to bear us up is real. You might want
                            to bring to memory the assurance of Elisha to his frightened servant.
                            That assurance is ours when we feel close to being overwhelmed in our
                            service. Elisha faced real and terrible opposition:<br>

                            &#8220;And when the servant of the man of God

                            both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my
                            master! how shall we do?</big></big></div>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>&#8220;And he
                        answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be
                        with them.
                    </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>&#8220;And Elisha
                        prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.
                        And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold,
                        the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about
                        Elisha.&#8221; (2 Kings 6:15-17)

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Like that
                        servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those you can see
                        opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal
                        eyes. The Lord will bear you up and will at times do it by calling
                        others to stand with you. That is why we have quorums. That is why
                        quorum leaders look at faces and into eyes in quorum meetings. That is
                        why the bishop is more than presiding in the priests quorum. He is
                        watching the faces of the priests. You will have such a bishop or such
                        an elders quorum president or such a mission president. And he will
                        come to help you and call others to stand with you. It may be to call
                        the right companion to serve with you in your time of need. <small><small

                                You recollect at one time a young man was with Elisha the Prophet, when
                                a large host compassed the city, both with horses and chariots, and a
                                battle was imminent.&nbsp; It was turbulent times with Israel then,
                                worse than it is with us now.&nbsp; The defending army was a very small
                                one, and the heart of the young man began to falter.&nbsp; He could not
                                see how the few of Israel were going to prevail against their numerous
                                enemies.&nbsp; Whereupon Elisha prayed, and said, "Lord, I pray thee,
                                open his eyes, that he" the young man "may see."&nbsp; And the Lord
                                opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw:&nbsp; and behold, the
                                mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about
                                Elisha.&nbsp; Fear not, said the Prophet, "for they that be with us are
