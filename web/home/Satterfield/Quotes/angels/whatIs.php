                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the broadest
                            sense, any being who acts as a messenger for our Heavenly Father is an
                            angel, be he a God, a resurrected man or the spirit of a just man; the
                            term is so used in all these senses in the ancient scriptures. In the
                            stricter and more limited sense an angel is, as the Prophet Joseph
                            states, a resurrected personage, having a body of flesh and bones. But
                            it must be remembered that none of the angels who appeared to men
                            before the death of the Savior could be of that class for none of them
                            were resurrected. ...</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We are taught to
                            believe that Adam was the first man who took a body on this earth.
                            There was no death before he fell. Who, then, was the angel who taught
                            him the law of sacrifice, or of faith and baptism, or who was the
                            cherubim with the flaming sword who guarded the tree of life? We cannot
                            admit that the scriptures are false and that these beings were not
                            angels; neither can we admit that Adam was not the first man and that
                            the Savior was not the first-fruits of the resurrection. Therefore, we
                            are forced to the conclusion that the word &#8220;angel&#8221; is used in the
                            scriptures for any heavenly being bearing God&#8217;s message or fulfilling
                            His commands; and, further, all beings who were created with the design
                            that they should inhabit this earth belong to it and to no other
                            planet. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Gospel Truth</span>, 1:68)<br>
