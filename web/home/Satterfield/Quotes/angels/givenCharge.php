                    Now, this is the
                    truth.&nbsp; We humble people; we who feel ourselves sometimes so
                    worthless, so good-for-nothing; we are not so worthless as we
                    think.&nbsp; There is not one of us but what God's love has been
                    expended upon.&nbsp; There is not one of us that He has not cared for
                    and caressed.&nbsp; There is not one of us that He has not desired to
                    save, and that He has not devised means to save. There is not one of us
                    that He has not given His angels charge concerning.&nbsp; We may be
                    insignificant and contemptible in our own eyes, and in the eyes of
                    others, but the truth remains that we are the children of God, and that
                    He has actually given His angels--<i>invisible beings of power and
                        might</i>--charge concerning us, and they watch over us and have us in
                    their keeping.&nbsp; Jesus has said, referring to His disciples:</font></span><font
                    size="5"><br style="font-family: arial;">
                <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                    "Take heed that ye
                    despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in
                    heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in
                    heaven."</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                </font>
                <span style="font-family: arial;"><font size="5"><br>
                    Those who
                    otherwise might be thought to be contemptible and unworthy of notice,
                    Jesus says be careful about offending them, for "their angels do always
                    behold the face of my Father."&nbsp; We are in their charge.&nbsp; They
                    watch over us, and are, to a certain extent, doubtless, responsible for
                    the watchcare that they exercise over us, just as we are responsible
                    for any duty that is assigned us.&nbsp; This is one great truth that
                    has been revealed to us.&nbsp; </font><font size="4">(<i>Collected

                            But the Gospel brings us into communication with
                            God, and makes us one with him and with those holy men of God who have
                            lived in the various ages feel interested in our welfare, and they are
                            watching over us, and we are better taken care of than many of us think
                            for.&nbsp; Many of us are careless, thoughtless, heedless, reckless,
                            unbelieving and full of doubts and anxiety; but God has given his
                            angels charge concerning us lest we should dash our foot against a
                            stone.&nbsp; God's bowels of mercy have been extended to us in spite of
                            our waywardness, folly, weakness, corruption and imbecility.<small>
