                            Also, I saw Elder Brigham Young standing in a strange land, in the far
                            south and west, in a desert place, upon a rock in the midst of about a
                            dozen men of color, who appeared hostile. He was preaching to them in
                            their own tongue, and the angel of God standing above his head, with a
                            drawn Sword in his hand, protecting him, but he did not see it. (<span

                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe we move
                            and have our being in the presence of heavenly messengers and of
                            heavenly beings. We are not separate from them. We begin to realize
                            more and more fully, as we become acquainted with the principles of the
                            Gospel, as they have been revealed anew in this dispensation, that we
                            are closely related to our kindred, to our ancestors, to our friends
                            and associates and co-laborers who have preceded us into the spirit
                            world. We cannot forget them; we do not cease to love them; we always
                            hold them in our hearts, in memory, and thus we are associated and
                            united to them by ties that we can not break, that we can not dissolve
                            or free ourselves from. If this is the case with us in our finite
                            condition, surrounded by our mortal weaknesses, shortsightedness, lack
                            of inspiration and wisdom from time to time, how much more certain it
                            is and reasonable and consistent to believe that those who have been
                            faithful, who have gone beyond and are still engaged in the work for
                            the salvation of the souls of men, the opening of the prison doors to
                            them that are bound and proclaiming liberty to the captives who can see
                            us better than we can see them; that they know us better than we know
                            them. They have advanced; we are advancing; we are growing as they have
                            grown; we are reaching the goal that they have attained unto; and
                            therefore, I claim that we live in their presence, they see us, they
                            are solicitous for our welfare, they love us now more than ever. For
                            now they see the dangers that beset us; they can comprehend better than
                            ever before, the weaknesses that are liable to mislead us into dark and
                            forbidden paths. They see the temptations and the evils that beset us
                            in life and the proneness of mortal beings to yield to temptation and
                            to wrong doing; hence their solicitude for us and their love for us and
                            their desire for our well being must be greater than that which we feel
                            for ourselves. I thank God for the feeling that I possess and enjoy and
                            for the realization that I have, that I stand, not only in the presence
                            of Almighty God, my Maker and Father, but in the presence of His Only
                            Begotten Son in the flesh, the Savior of the world; and I stand in the
                            presence of Peter and James, (and perhaps the eyes of John are also
                            upon us and we know it not); and that I stand also in the presence of
                            Joseph and Hyrum and Brigham and John, and those who have been valiant
                            in the testimony of Jesus Christ and faithful to their mission in the
                            world, who have gone before. When I go I want to have the privilege of
                            meeting them with the consciousness that I have followed their example,
                            that I have carried out the mission in which they were engaged as they
                            would have it carried out; that I have been as faithful in the
                            discharge of duty committed to me and required at my hand as they were
                            faithful in their time, and that when I meet them I shall meet them as
                            I met them here, in love, in harmony, in unison and in perfect
                            confidence that I have done my duty as they have done theirs.&nbsp;

                            scriptures and our brethren explain. They have told us the spirit world
                            is right here round about us, and the only spirits who can live here
                            are those who are assigned to fill their missions here on earth. This
                            is the spirit world. And if our eyes could be opened we could see those
                            who have departed from us&#8212;a father, mother, brother, a sister, a child.
                            We could see them, and sometimes when our physical senses are asleep,
                            sometimes our spiritual self&#8212;and we have ears, spiritual ears, and
                            spiritual eyes&#8212;sometimes they will be very keen and awake, and a
                            departed one may come while we are lying asleep and come into our
                            consciousness. We&#8217;ll feel an impression. We&#8217;ll wake up. Where does it
