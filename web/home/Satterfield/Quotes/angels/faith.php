                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nephi, in a great,
                            profound sermon of instruction, explained that &#8220;angels speak by the
                            power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.
                            Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold,
                            the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.&#8221; (2 Ne.
                            32:3.)</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Should an angel
                            appear and converse with you, neither you nor he would be confined to
                            corporeal sight or sound in order to communicate. For there is that
                            spiritual process, described by the Prophet Joseph Smith, by which pure
                            intelligence can flow into our minds and we can know what we need to
                            know without either the drudgery of study or the passage of time, for
                            it is revelation.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the Prophet
                            said further:</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#8220;All things
                            whatsoever God in his infinite wisdom has seen fit and proper to reveal
                            to us, while we are dwelling in mortality, in regard to our mortal
                            bodies, are revealed to us in the abstract &#8230; revealed to our spirits
                            precisely as though we had no bodies at all; and those revelations
                            which will save our spirits will save our bodies.&#8221; (Teachings, p. 355.)
