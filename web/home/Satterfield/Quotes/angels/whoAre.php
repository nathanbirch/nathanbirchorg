                                <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a
                                    prevailing idea today,
                                    which arose during the centuries of apostasy, that angels are superior
                                    to human beings in their nature&#8211;in fact, that they belong to an
                                    entirely distinct and different race.&nbsp; Angels are ministering
                                    servants
                                    who carry messages from our Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ.
                                    All angels coming to Adam after the fall were spirits belonging to this
                                    earth who had not yet obtained bodies of flesh and bones. After men had
                                    been translated as was Enoch, they, as translated beings, could and did
                                    come to minister unto the prophets. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Answers

                                <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have no doubt
                                    of the correctness of the statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith that
                                    &#8220;there are no angels who minister to this earth but those who do belong
                                    or have belonged to it&#8221; (D&amp;C 130:5); but that does not necessarily
                                    imply that they did not belong to the earth before they took a mortal
                                    body. In our opinion they belonged to this earth from the time of its
                                    creation, when they covenanted to come and take bodies thereon, at the
                                    time that the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God
                                    shouted for joy. (Gospel Truth, p. 54)</span><br

                                <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are told by the
                                    Prophet Joseph
                                    Smith, that &#8220;there are no angels who minister to this earth but those
                                    who do belong or have belonged to it.&#8221; Hence, when messengers are sent
                                    to minister to the inhabitants of this earth, they are not strangers,
                                    but from the ranks of our kindred, friends, and fellow-beings and
                                    fellow-servants. The ancient prophets who died were those who came to
                                    visit their fellow creatures upon the earth.&nbsp; They came to
                                    Abraham, to
                                    Isaac, and to Jacob; it was such beings-holy beings if you please-who
                                    waited upon the Savior and administered to him on the Mount. The angel
                                    that visited John, when an exile, and unfolded to his vision future
                                    events in the history of man upon the earth, was one who had been here,
                                    who had toiled and suffered in common with the people of God; for you
                                    remember that John, after his eyes had beheld the glories of the great
                                    future, was about to fall down and worship him, but was peremptorily
                                    forbidden to do so. &#8220;See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant,
                                    and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of
                                    this book....&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                                <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner our
                                    fathers and
                                    mothers, brothers, sisters and friends who have passed away from this
                                    earth, having been faithful, and worthy to enjoy these rights and
                                    privileges, may have a mission given them to visit their relatives and
                                    friends upon the earth again, bringing from the divine Presence
                                    messages of love, of warning, or reproof and instruction, to those whom
                                    they had learned to love in the flesh. And so it is with Sister Cannon.
                                    She can return and visit her friends, provided it be in accordance with
                                    the wisdom of the Almighty. There are laws to which they who are in the
                                    Paradise of God must be subject, as well as laws to which we are
                                    subject. It is our duty to make ourselves acquainted with those laws,
                                    that we may know how to live in harmony with his will while we dwell in
                                    the flesh, that we may be entitled to come forth in the morning of the
                                    first resurrection, clothed with glory, immortality and eternal lives,
                                    and be permitted to sit down at the right hand of God, in the kingdom
                                    of heaven. </span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                                <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And except we
                                    become acquainted
                                    with those laws, and live in harmony with them, we need not expect to
                                    enjoy these privileges; Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, Heber
                                    C. Kimball, Jedediah M. Grant, David Patten, Joseph Smith, Sen., and
                                    all those noble men who took an active part in the establishment of
                                    this work, and who died true and faithful to their trust, have the
                                    right and privilege, and possess the keys and power, to minister to the
                                    people of God in the flesh who live now, as much so and on the same
                                    principle as the ancient servants of God had the right to return to the
                                    earth and minister to the Saints of God in their day. (<span
