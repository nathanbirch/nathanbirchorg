                            which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of
                            repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and
                            this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi
                            do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.</span><br

                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The power and
                            authority of the lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold the keys of
                            the ministering of angels, and to administer in outward ordinances, the
                            letter of the gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of
                            sins, agreeable to the covenants and commandments.<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say that the Priesthood, which is the agency of
                            our heavenly Father, holds the keys of the ministering of angels. What
                            is a key? It is the right or privilege which belongs to and comes with
                            the Priesthood, to have communication with God. Is not that a key? Most
                            decidedly. We may not enjoy the blessings, or key, very much, but the
                            key is in the Priesthood. It is the right to enjoy the blessing of
                            communication with the heavens, and the privilege and authority to
                            administer in the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ, to preach
                            the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission
                            of sins. That is a key. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Gospel

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John next said that he conferred the Priesthood of
                            Aaron&#8212;Aaron who held this marvelous power and authority. John went on
                            to say that this priesthood &#8220;holds the keys of the ministering of
                            angels.&#8221; What are keys? They represent the authority to unlock and make
                            available certain specific and wonderful blessings including the
                            &#8220;ministering of angels.&#8221; Every boy who holds the Aaronic Priesthood is
                            entitled to the ministering of angels if he lives worthy of it. That
                            means that he may call upon divine power for protection, for guidance,
                            for comfort, for strength. I believe that John was not using idle words
                            when he spoke of ministering angels. I think he was conferring a
                            resource of priceless worth to be made available to those holding the
                            priesthood provided they sought it and lived for it. (&#8220;Upon You My
