                                    through the dispensations, God has used angels as His emissaries in
                                    conveying love and concern for His children. Time in this setting does
                                    not allow even a cursory examination of the scriptures or our own
                                    latter-day history, which are so filled with accounts of angels
                                    ministering to those on earth, but it is rich doctrine and rich history
                                    indeed.

                            <><big style="font-family: arial;"><big>Usually such beings are <em>not</em>
                                    seen. Sometimes they are. But seen or unseen they are <em>always</em>
                                    near.</big></big></>&nbsp; <big style="font-family: arial;"><big>Sometimes
                                    their assignments are very grand and have significance for the whole
                                    world. Sometimes the messages are more private. Occasionally the
                                    angelic purpose is to warn. But most often it is to comfort, to provide
                                    some form of merciful attention, guidance in difficult times. When in
                                    Lehi&#8217;s dream he found himself in a frightening place, &#8220;a dark and
                                    dreary waste,&#8221; as he described it, he was met by an angel, &#8220;a man &#8230;
                                    dressed in a white robe; &#8230; he spake unto me,&#8221; Lehi said, &#8220;and bade me
                                    follow him.&#8221; (1 Ne. 8:7, 5-6) Lehi did follow him to safety and
                                    ultimately to the path of salvation.<br>
                                </big></big>
                            <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big>In the course of life all of
                                    us spend time in &#8220;dark and dreary&#8221; places, wildernesses, circumstances
                                    of sorrow or fear or discouragement. Our present day is filled with
                                    global distress over financial crises, energy problems, terrorist
                                    attacks, and natural calamities. These translate into individual and
                                    family concerns not only about homes in which to live and food
                                    available to eat but also about the ultimate safety and well-being of
                                    our children and the latter-day prophecies about our planet. More
                                    serious than these&#8212;and sometimes related to them&#8212;are matters of
                                    ethical, moral, and spiritual decay seen in populations large and
                                    small, at home and abroad. But I testify that angels are <em>still</em>
                                    sent to help <em>us,</em> even as they were sent to help Adam and Eve,
                                    to help the prophets, and indeed to help the Savior of the world
                                    Himself. Matthew records in his gospel that after Satan had tempted
                                    Christ in the wilderness &#8220;angels came and ministered unto him.&#8221;<a
                                        class="footnote" href="#footnote8"> (Matt. 4:11)&nbsp;</a> Even the
                                    Son of God, a God Himself, had need for heavenly comfort during His
                                    sojourn in mortality. And so such ministrations will be to the
                                    righteous until the end of time. As Mormon said to his son Moroni, who
                                    would one day <em>be</em> an angel:</big></big></p>
