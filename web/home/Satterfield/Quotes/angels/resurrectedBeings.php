                            kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected
                            personages, having bodies of flesh and bones &#8211; For instance, Jesus
                            said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye
                            see me have.&nbsp; Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they
                            who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory.</span><br

                            thought has been conveyed to the minds of some that a personage cannot
                            be an angel unless he is resurrected and has a body of flesh and bones.
                            Any messenger sent from the presence of the Lord with a message is an
                            angel.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">Doctrine and Covenants

                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[Responding to a
                            question regarding D&amp;C 129:1. Elder Charles W. Penrose of the
                            Quorum of the Twelve said:] Take, for example, the quotation in the
                            foregoing letter of inquiry, from section 129, verse 1, of the Doctrine
                            and Covenants; reference to the text cited will show that it is not
                            there stated that &#8220;all&#8221; angels are resurrected beings, a notion that
                            our inquirer, like some other persons, seems to entertain and which
                            forms the origin of his trouble. The theme discoursed upon is the
                            presence in heaven of two kinds or classes of beings, namely first,
                            resurrected beings and, second, spirits who are not resurrected. It is
                            not asserted that there are no other kinds of persons in heaven than
                            they, but the subject treated is of the two classes mentioned.</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are angels
                            of various appointments and stations. Michael is called an &#8220;archangel&#8221;
                            (Doc. &amp; Cov. 29:26; Dan. 10:13). Some are resurrected beings like
                            the angel that was sent to John the Revelator (Rev. 23:8, 9) and those
                            already referred to in Doc. &amp; Cov. sec. 132, while others are
                            &#8220;ministering spirits sent forth to minister unto them who shall be
                            heirs of salvation&#8221; (Heb. 1:14). Some of these angels are described as
                            &#8220;the spirits of just men made perfect&#8221; and are &#8220;not resurrected,&#8221; and
                            others were made ministering spirits before entering into mortality,
                            serving among their fellows in their pre-existent state. Christ was a
                            ministering spirit before his birth into this world. He was &#8220;anointed
                            above his fellows.&#8221; The angel Gabriel was a ministering spirit after he
                            had been a mortal man (Noah), and before his resurrection, for Jesus of
                            Nazareth was, as quoted by &#8220;Subscriber,&#8221; &#8220;the first-fruits of them that
                            slept.&#8221; (See Luke 1:11-30; Dan. 8:16; 9:21.)</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Angels are God&#8217;s
                            messengers, whether used in that capacity as unembodied spirits,
                            selected according to their capacities for the work required, or as
                            disembodied spirits, or as translated men, or as resurrected beings.
                            They are agents of Deity of different degrees of intelligence, power
                            and authority, under the direction of higher dignitaries, and subject
                            to law and order in their respective spheres. ...&nbsp; Thus it will be
                            seen that all angels are not resurrected beings, nor is it so declared,
                            as imagined by the writer of the letter here replied to.&nbsp;
