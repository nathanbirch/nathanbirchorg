                            that power which holds the keys to the ministering of angels. Think of

                            boy who holds the Aaronic Priesthood is entitled to the ministering of
                            angels if he lives worthy of it. That means that he may call upon
                            divine power for protection, for guidance, for comfort, for strength. I
                            believe that John was not using idle words when he spoke of ministering
                            angels. I think he was conferring a resource of priceless worth to be
                            made available to those holding the priesthood provided they sought it
                            and lived for it. <small>(&#8220;Upon You My Fellow Servants,&#8221; <span

                            of the fact that you hold the priesthood of God. When John the Baptist
                            conferred the Aaronic Priesthood upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery,
                            he stated that this priesthood &#8220;holds the keys of the ministering of
                            angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion
                            for the remission of sins&#8221; (D&amp;C 13).</span><br

                            will bring with it incomparable rewards. Take the high road in your

                            hand, and give [you] answer to [your] prayers&#8221; (D&amp;C 112:10). <small>[&#8220;To
