                                children of God, the offspring of the Father, his sons and his
                                daughters. . . What is not so well known is that nearly all the
                                passages of scripture, both ancient and modern, which speak of God as
                                our Father and of men on earth being the sons of God, have no reference
                                to our birth in preexistence as the children of Elohim, but teach
                                rather that Jehovah is our Father and we are his children.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></big><br

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                In setting forth that all men must be born again to gain salvation, we
                                have seen that this means they must be "born of God, changed from their
                                carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of
                                God, becoming his sons and daughters." (Mosiah 27:25.) Whose sons and
                                whose daughters do we become when we are born again? Who is our new
                                Father? <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The
                                    answer is, Christ is our Father; we become his children by adoption; he
                                    makes us members of his family</span>.... </span></big></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">But there
                                    is more than this to the doctrine of becoming sons of God. Those who so
                                    obtain are adopted also into the family of Elohim. They become his
                                    adopted sons so that they can receive, inherit, and possess along with
                                    his natural Son</span>. </span></big></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                To envision what is meant by being sons of God, meaning the Father, let
                                us follow Paul's reasoning in two passages of superlative insight and
                                inspiration. To the Romans our apostolic friend of old wrote: "For as
                                many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."
                                Standing alone, this could be taken to mean that by faith the saints
                                become the sons of the Lord Jesus. But the perspective begins to change
                                when our apostolic colleague says: "Ye have received the Spirit of
                                adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." That is, we call upon our
                                Eternal Father in a familiar and friendly way, as children here call to
                                their fathers with whom they maintain a familiar intimacy. Having
                                attained this state of friendship with the Eternal One, "The Spirit
                                itself beareth witness with our spirit," Paul continues, "that we are
                                the children of God." He has now laid the groundwork. A pronouncement
                                of deep and wondrous import is immediately forthcoming. "And if
                                children"&#8211;note it well&#8211;"then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
                                Christ." (Rom. 8:14-17.) ... </span></big></big><br

                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                The reasoning is perfect. <span style="font-style: italic;">The Father
                                    had a Son, a natural Son, his own literal Seed, the Offspring of his
                                    body. This Son is his heir. As an heir he inherits all things from his
                                    Father&#8211;all power, all might, all dominion, the world, the universe,
                                    kingship, eternal exaltation, all things. <span
                                        style="text-decoration: underline;">But our revelations speak of men
                                        being exalted also and of their ascending the throne of eternal power</span>.
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How is it done</span>? <span
                                        style="text-decoration: underline;">Paul has explained it perfectly.
                                        They are adopted into the family of the Father</span>. <span
                                        style="text-decoration: underline;">They become joint-heirs with his
                                        natural Son</span></span> ... </span></big></big><br
                        style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                They constitute the sole and only way the eternal increase of an
                                Eternal Father can become like their great Progenitor. As pertaining to
                                this earth, they were revealed first to father Adam. He was baptized,
                                born again, received the priesthood, and kept the commandments. As a
                                result thereof, "a voice out of heaven" proclaimed: "Thou art one in
                                me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons." (Moses 6:65-68.)
                                "Our father Adam taught these things," the scripture says, "and many
                                have believed and become the sons of God, and many have believed not,
                                and have perished in their sins." (Moses 7:1.)&nbsp;<small> (<span

                                4:1-7), inheritors of all that the Father hath. (D. &amp; C.
                                134:33-41.) In his famous King Follett Sermon, speaking of those who
                                &#8220;shall be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ,&#8221; the Prophet
                                asked what their glory should be. Answering his own query, he described
                                joint-heirship as inheriting &#8220;the same power, the same glory and the
                                same exaltation, until you arrive at the station of a God, and ascend
                                the throne of eternal power, the same as those who have gone before.&#8221;

                                so do all others. If one has all power, so do all those who inherit
                                jointly with him. If the universe belongs to one, so it does equally to

                                things are theirs for they have exaltation. (D. &amp; C. 76:50-60.)

                                The ordinances of the temple, the endowment and sealings, pertain to
                                exaltation in the celestial kingdom, where the sons and daughters are.
                                The sons and daughters are not outside in some other kingdom. The sons
                                and daughters go into the house, belong to the household, have access
                                to the home. "In my Father's house are many mansions." Sons and
                                daughters have access to the home where he dwells, and you cannot
                                receive that access until you go to the temple. Why? Because you must
                                receive certain key words as well as make covenants by which you are
                                able to enter. If you try to get into the house, and the door is
                                locked, how are you going to enter, if you haven't your key? You get
                                your key in the temple, which will admit you.<small> (<span

                                    between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other--and
                                    behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead [and other
                                    temple ordinances]. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither
                                    can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made
                                    perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is
                                    necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of
                                    times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole
                                    and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations,
                                    and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed
                                    from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but
                                    those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the
                                    world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be
                                    revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the
                                    fulness of times.&nbsp; <small>(D&amp;C 128:18)</small></big></font></big><br>

                            months before the
                            Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred, he delivered a discourse to a large
                            assembly of Saints. Elder Wilford Woodruff, who recorded a synopsis of
                            the discourse, said that the Prophet spoke on "one of the most
                            important and interesting subjects ever presented to the Saints."&nbsp;
                            As
                            part of this sermon, the Prophet testified of the eternal nature of
                            families. He spoke of the need to be sealed to our parents and to
                            continue that sealing ordinance throughout our generations:</span><br

                            "This is the spirit of
                            Elijah, that we redeem our dead and connect ourselves with our fathers
                            which are in heaven and seal up our dead to come forth in the first
                            resurrection, and here we want the power of Elijah to seal those who
                            dwell on earth to those which dwell in heaven. &#8230; Go and seal on earth
                            your sons and daughters unto yourself and yourself unto your fathers in
                            eternal glory." </span><br
                            style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">

                            For the next few decades, the
                            Latter-day Saints knew that there was to be "a welding link of some
                            kind or other between the fathers and the children" (D&amp;C 128:18).
                            However, their procedures were not completely set in order; as
                            President Woodruff observed, the Prophet Joseph had not lived long
                            enough to "enter any further upon these things."&nbsp; Acting according
                            to
                            "all the light and knowledge [they] had," they often had themselves
                            sealed, or "adopted," to Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, or other Church
                            leaders of their day rather than to their own fathers and mothers. As
                            President of the Church, President Woodruff referred to this practice,
                            saying: "We have not fully carried out those principles in fulfillment
                            of the revelations of God to us, in sealing the hearts of the fathers
                            to the children and the children to the fathers. I have not felt
                            satisfied, neither did President [John] Taylor, neither has any man
                            since the Prophet Joseph who has attended to the ordinance of adoption
                            in the temples of our God. We have felt that there was more to be
                            revealed upon this subject than we had received."</span><br

                            That additional revelation
                            came to President Woodruff on April 5, 1894. Three days later, in a
                            general conference address, he told of the revelation:</span><br

                                have.&nbsp; We have felt, as President Taylor said, that we have got to
                                have
                                more&nbsp; revelation&nbsp; concerning sealing under the law of
                                adoption.&nbsp; Well,
                                what are these changes?&nbsp; One of them is the principle of
                                adoption.&nbsp; In
                                the commencement of adopting men and women in the Temple at Nauvoo, a
                                great many persons were adopted to different men who were not of the
                                lineage of their fathers, and there was a spirit manifested by some in
                                that work that was not of God. ..President Young was not satisfied in
                                his mind with regard to the extent of this matter;&nbsp; President
                                Taylor
                                was not.&nbsp; </span></big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big><big><span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                                When I went before the Lord to
                                know who I should be adopted to (we were then being adopted to prophets
                                and apostles), the Spirit of God said to me, &#8220;Have you not a father,
                                who begot you?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Then why not honor
                                him?&nbsp; Why not be
                                adopted to him?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; says I, &#8220;that is right.&#8221;&nbsp; I was
                                adopted to my
                                father, and should have had my father sealed to his father, and so on
                                back; and the duty that I want every man who presides over a temple to
                                see performed from this day henceforth and forever, unless the Lord
                                Almighty commands otherwise, is, let every man be adopted to his
                                father.&nbsp; When a man receives the endowments, adopt him to his
                                father;
                                not to Wilford Woodruff, nor to any other man outside the lineage of
                                his fathers.&nbsp; That is the will of God to this people.&nbsp; I want
                                all men
                                who preside over these temples in these mountains of Israel to bear
                                this in mind. What business have I to take away the rights of the
                                lineage of any man? What right has any man to do this?. No; I say let
                                every man be adopted to his father; and then you will do exactly what
                                God said when he declared he would send Elijah the prophet in the last
                                days. Elijah the prophet appeared unto Joseph Smith and told him that
                                the day had come when this principle must be carried out. Joseph Smith
                                did not live long enough to enter any further upon these things. His
                                soul was wound up with this work before he was martyred for the word of
                                God and testimony of Jesus Christ. He told us that there must be a
                                welding link of all dispensations and of the work of God from one
                                generation to another. This was upon his mind more than most any other
                                subject that was given to him.<small> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Messages

                                Thus I, for instance, will stand at the head of my family group by
                                virtue of the sealing for time and eternity, and my children will
                                belong to me. I will belong to my parents in their family group. My

                                him-all linked together generation to generation like a chain. So it

                                this grouping of families will have to stand aside, and those who are
                                worthy will be brought together and the chain will go on just the same.

                                        By the power of this priesthood restored by the Prophet Elijah, it
                                        is now possible for a man to prove his love for his wife and family by
                                        living righteously enough to be worthy to take them with him into a
                                        temple of the Lord and have them sealed to him, not for this life
                                        alone, but by this great sealing power to have that union sealed in the
                                        heavens for all eternity. When the poet sang of a love which would last
                                        until the "stars grow old and the sun grows cold," he was not singing
                                        of a love that was only to last "until death do you part," but of a
                                        marriage that would last throughout the eternity of time, never
                                        withering, never dying, never growing old or commonplace.</small></span></big></big></big><br>

                                        By the same token, then, our hearts being turned to the promises
                                        made to the fathers, we are also turned to the fathers themselves.
                                        Should they languish in a spirit prison or be held back from spiritual
                                        growth because they were born at a time when this sealing power was not
                                        on the earth? As God is a just God and one who loves his children, a
                                        way has been prepared whereby those who are dead may be identified and
                                        then sealed together in a family relationship in the temples of the
                                        Lord by their descendants who love them enough to do this work for them.</small></span></big></big></big><br>

                            They are legitimate heirs of the Priesthood and of the blessings of the
                            new and everlasting covenant. But not so with those who have been born
                            outside of this covenant. There has to be some ordinance performed in
                            order
                            to make them legitimate; and that ordinance, the Prophet Joseph
                            revealed,
                            was the ordinance of adoption; that is, that which covers the ordinance
                            or law, although we do not use the word adoption when we seal children
                            to parents; we call that sealing. &nbsp;<small>(<span
