                                Whittemore Carter were married on April 13, 1837, in Kirtland, Ohio.
                                Throughout their life together, they endured many trials, thus growing
                                in their devotion to each other, their children, and the kingdom of
                                God. One such experience came in the winter of 1838, about five months
                                before Wilford Woodruff&#8217;s call to the apostleship. As Brother Woodruff
                                led a group of Saints on a journey to gather with other members of the
                                Church, his wife became very ill. He later recounted:</span></span>

                        23rd of November my
                        wife, Phoebe, was attacked with a severe headache, which terminated in
                        brain fever. She grew more and more distressed daily as we continued
                        our journey. It was a terrible ordeal for a woman to travel in a wagon
                        over rough roads, afflicted as she was. At the same time our child was
                        also very sick.&#8221;

                        on their journey and find places to rest. Brother Woodruff recalled:
                        &#8220;December 3rd found my wife very
                        low. I spent the day in taking care of
                        her, and the following day I returned to Eaton [a nearby town] to get
                        some things for her. She seemed to be gradually sinking, and in the
                        evening her spirit apparently left her body, and she was dead.

                        in his faith,
                        Wilford Woodruff gave his wife a priesthood blessing. &#8220;I laid my hands
                        upon her,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
                        in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuked the
                        power of death and the destroyer, and commanded the same to depart from
                        her, and the spirit of life to enter her body.

                        spirit returned to her
                        body, and from that hour she was made whole; and we all felt to praise
                        the name of God, and to trust in him and keep his commandments.<br>
                        <br>
                        &#8220;While this operation was going on with me (as my wife related
                        afterwards) her spirit left her body, and she saw her body lying upon
                        the bed, and the sisters weeping. She looked at them and at me, and
                        upon her babe, and, while gazing upon this scene, two personages came
                        into the room. &#8230; One of these messengers informed her that she could
                        have her choice: she might go to rest in the spirit world, or, on one
                        condition she could have the privilege of returning to her tabernacle
                        and continuing her labors upon the earth. The condition was, if she
                        felt that she could stand by her husband, and with him pass through all
                        the cares, trials, tribulations and afflictions of life which he would
                        be called to pass through for the Gospel&#8217;s sake unto the end. When she
                        looked at the situation of her husband and child she said: &#8216;Yes, I will
                        do it!&#8217;</big></big>
