                            of Israel begins with the Abrahamic covenant. In the covenant, God
                            promises
                            that all the nations of the world will be blessed through Abraham's

                            This will be accomplished through the scattering of Israel among the
                            nations
                            and then gathering them again. The following quotes will help in

                                as a distinct people. They have not mixed to any great extent with the

                                    join
                                    itself with the earth, or that the tribe of Dan is in Denmark the tribe
                                    of Reuben in Russia, and so forth. A common cliche asserts: "If we knew
                                    where the Lost Tribes were, they would not be lost." True it is that
                                    they
                                    are lost from the knowledge of the world; they are not seen and
                                    recognized
                                    as the kingdom they once were; but in general terms, their whereabouts
                                    is known. They are scattered in all the nations of the earth, primarily
                                    in the nations north of the lands of their first inheritance. (</span><i

                            brought forth much fruit.

                            said unto his servant: Look hither; behold I have planted another
                            branch
                            of the tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer
                            than the first. But, behold the tree. I have nourished it this long
                            time,
                            and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay it
                            up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self.

                            said again unto his servant: Look hither, and behold another branch
                            also,
                            which I have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and it hath
                            brought forth fruit.

                            behold the last. Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground
                            [the
                            Americas]; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of
                            the
                            tree hath brought forth tame fruit [Nephites], and the other part of
                            the
                            tree hath brought forth wild fruit [Lamanites]; behold, I have
                            nourished
                            this tree like unto the others.

                            said unto the servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought
                            forth
                            good fruit, and cast them into the fire.

                            27 But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us
                            prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little longer, that
                            perhaps
                            it may bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up

                            But, says another, did not Jesus visit them after
                            he ministered among the Nephites? Answer: Of course he did, in one or
                            many
                            places as suited his purposes. He assembled them together then in
                            exactly
                            the same way he gathered the Nephites in the land Bountiful so that
                            they
                            too could hear his voice and feel the prints of the nails in his hands
                            and in his feet. Of this there can be no question. And we suppose that
                            he also called twelve apostles and established his kingdom among them
                            even
                            as he did in Jerusalem and in the Americas. Who should he deal any
                            differently
                            with one branch of Israel than with another?

                                Query: What happened to the Ten Tribes after the
                                visit of the Savior to them near the end of the thirty-fourth year
                                following
                                his birth? Answer: The same thing that happened to the Nephites. There
                                was righteousness for a season, and then there was apostasy and
                                wickedness.

                                to go to every nation and kindred and tongue and people upon the face

                            Joseph
                            Smith including the keys of the kingdom. Joseph Smith restored the
                            Church
                            on April 6, 1830. Then according to D&amp;C 110, on April 3, 1836,
                            Moses
                            appeared to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple and restored the keys
                            for
                            Israel's gathering and restoration to the land they were driven from:</i>

                        are involved in this commission. First
                        Israel -- all Israel, the Ten Tribes included -- is to be gathered
                        "from
                        the four parts of the earth," out of every nation and from among every
                        people. They are to be gathered into the true church and fold of the
                        God
                        of Israel. This gathering is primarily spiritual, but it is also
                        temporal
                        in that the gathered sheep are assembled into the stakes of Zion where
                        the living waters flow. But, next, this commission directs the one who
                        holds the keys of the gathering, meaning the President of the Church,
                        to
                        lead the Ten Tribes from the land of the north to their destined
                        Palestinian
                        homeland. They will be led to their promised inheritances after they
                        join
                        the Church, after they return unto the Lord, after they believe in
                        Christ
                        and accept his gospel, after they receive, individually and
                        collectively,
                        the Abrahamic covenant again. This part of the gathering of Israel is
                        Millennial
                        for that is the assigned period in which the Ten Tribes are to come
                        forth;
                        that is the day in which the kingdom will be restored to Israel in the
                        political as well as the ecclesiastical sense. (<i>A New Witness for

                        "lost

                        with other peoples. This gathering, which includes the converted
                        Gentiles,
                        is preliminary to the glorious advent of the King of kings, and the
                        resurrection
                        of those who are Christ's at His coming. The places of assembly are
                        America
                        and Palestine, the former taking chronological precedence as the

                        place of "Ephraim and his fellows," while the "dispersed of Judah" will
                        migrate to and rebuild Jerusalem. Here, upon the American continent,
                        will
                        be reared Zion, a new Jerusalem, where the Saints will eventually
                        assemble

                                Lord calls attention to the fact that when the fulness of the Gentiles
                                should come in, a light should break forth among those that sat in
                                darkness,
                                and it should be the fulness of the everlasting gospel, but they would
                                reject it. And in that generation shall the time of the Gentiles be
                                fulfilled.
                                In the 133rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants, he warns all the

                                literal descendant of Joseph who was sold into Egypt, and the Lord
                                called

                        about the gathering of Israel by the
                        same prophet might seem to be repetitive. In part they are, for
                        repetition
                        is sound pedagogy, but they also tell of gatherings that will occur by
                        stages and in different locations. Israel was not scattered at one
                        time;
                        indeed, the main phases of the scattering went forward for a thousand
                        years.
                        And Israel will not be gathered all at one time. The gathering
                        commenced
                        with the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                        Saints
                        in 1830; it was formalized and took on a divine impetus with the
                        restoration
                        of the keys by Moses in 1836; and it has grown in scope and intensity
                        ever
                        since. Once it was centered in Kirtland, Ohio, then in Missouri, and
                        then
                        in Illinois. For nearly a hundred years the new converts flowed to the
                        tops of the Rocky Mountains, and now they are counseled to remain in
                        the
                        stakes of Zion in the nations of their inheritance. It will thus
                        continue
                        on a worldwide basis until the Second Coming and then go on into the
                        Millennium
                        for as long as is necessary to perfect the work and convert the world.
                        We see no reason why this Millennial phase should take longer than a
                        single
                        generation. (<i>A New Witness for the Articles of Faith</i>, pp.

                        of
                        Zion is part of Zion. You cannot create a staek of Zion without
                        creating
                        a part of Zion. Zion is the pure in heart; we gain purity of heart by
                        baptism
                        and by obedience. A stake has geographical bounderies. To create a
                        stake
                        is like founding a City of Holiness. Every stake on earth is the
                        gathering

                        Never in this dispensation, and perhaps never before in any single
                        period,
                        has there been such a feeling of urgency among the members of this

                        In the early years of the Church specific places to which the Saints
                        were
                        to be gathered together were given, and the Lord directed that these
                        gathering
                        places should not be changed, but then he gave one qualification'
                        "Until
                        the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I

                        glorious day of restoration and gathering,
                        another Nephite prophet said: 'The Lord . . . has covenanted with all
                        the

                        call your attention to the facts, set forth
                        in these scriptures,that the gathering of Israel consists of joining
                        the
                        true church; of coming to a knowledge of the true God and of his saving
                        truths; and of worshiping him in the congregations of the Saints in all
                        nations and among all peoples. Please note that these revealed words
                        speak
                        of the folds of the Lord; of Israel being gathered to the lands of
                        their
                        inheritance; of Israel being established in all their lands of promise;
                        and of there being congregations of the covenant people of the Lord in
                        every nation, speaking every tongue, and among every people when the
                        Lord

                        Elder McConkie then concluded with this statement,
                        which certainly emphasizes the great need for the teaching and training
                        of local leadership in order to build up the church within their own
                        native
                        countries:

                        are no longer to come to a single place.
                        In 1955, Sister Kimball and I went to Europe. We spent six months
                        touring
                        all of the missions in Europe. The people were still laboring under the
                        impression that they should come to America for the gathering process.
                        The burden of our sermons to them was, "Stay where you are. You have
                        received
                        the gospel. The blessings will be brought to you. It will not be long
                        until
                        you have stakes, and the Brethren will come across the ocean to visit
                        you.
                        Eventually temples will come, and you will have all the blessings of
                        Zion."

                        Zion was all of America and that it is like a great bird with two wide
                        wings: North America and South America.

                        people have been holding their breath waiting
                        to see the gathering of Israel. We are in Israel and are being
                        gathered.

                        the early days of the Church we used to
                        preach for the people to come to Utah as the gathering process, largely
                        because that was the only place in the whole world where there was a
                        temple.
                        Now we have sixteen temples, and two more that have been approved,
                        scattered
                        throughout the world. So it is no longer necessary that we bring the
                        people
                        all to Salt Lake City. Our missionaries preach baptism and
                        confirmation.
                        And then we come to you with conferences and to organize stakes. So we
                        say again, stay in Korea. This is a beautiful land. In this land you
                        can
                        teach your children just as well as you could in Salt Lake City. Stay
                        in
                        Korea where you can teach the gospel to millions of people.

                        gathering is taking place. Korea is the

                        Brazilians,
                        England for the English. And so we move forward toward the confirmation

                        inadvertently, we have given artificial
                        encouragement to individuals to leave their native land and culture
                        and,
                        too often, this has meant the loss of the leaven that is so badly
                        needed,
                        and the individuals involved have sometimes regretted their migrations.

                            think this is the stumbling block. This has been
                            interpreted to mean that the remnant of Jacob are those of the
                            descendants
                            of Lehi, but there is nothing in the passage as I read it which should
                            convey this thought. Remember that all through the Lord has been
                            speaking
                            of the remnant of Jacob or Israel, and of the great promises made to
                            the

                        the ten tribes from the land of the north." (D&amp;C 110:11.) Again
                        there
                        is a distinction between Israel as a whole and the Ten Tribes who are

                        why it is one thing to gather Israel from the four parts of the earth

                        northward,
                        in a body, under prophetic guidance; and that they were then splintered
                        and driven and scattered into all places and among all peoples. These
                        Ten
                        Tribes, no matter where they are located, are in nations and places

                        of the north.

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>The tribe
                        of Ephraim is one of the Ten Tribes; and
                        her people became wanderers in the nations, where they now reside and
                        where
                        they are now being found and gathered, one of a city and two of a
                        family,
                        into the stakes of Zion in those nations. This gathering of Israel is
                        not
                        to an American Zion; it is not to Palestine and the ancient holy land;
                        it is not to any central place or location. Rather, it is to the holy
                        places
                        of safety that are now being set up in all nations as rapidly as our
                        strength
                        and means permit. As we have seen, this gathering of Ephraim falls in
                        the
                        category of the gathering of Israel and not of the leading of the Ten
                        Tribes
                        from the land of the north. This gathering of Ephraim is into the
                        stakes
                        of Zion in all the nations of the earth. There are, of course, isolated
                        and unusual instances of people from the other lost tribes gathering
                        with
                        Ephraim, but these are few and far between. The gathering of these
                        other
                        tribes is not yet, but by and by.

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>What, then,
                        is meant by the leading of the Ten
                        Tribes
                        from the land of the north? Our answer is: Just what the words say. We
                        are gathering Israel now in all nations and counseling them to stay
                        where
                        they are, there to enlarge the borders of Zion, there to build up
                        stakes
                        of Zion in their own lands and among their own people. But with the Ten
                        Tribes, in part at least, it will be another thing. They are destined
                        to
                        return (at least in large and representative numbers) to the same soil
                        where the feet of their forebears walked during the days of their
                        mortal
                        pilgrimage. They are to return to Palestine. At least a constituent
                        assembly
                        will congregate there in the very land given of God to Abraham their
                        father.
                        Others will, of course, be in America and in all lands, but the formal
                        return, the return from the north countries, will be to the land of
                        their
                        ancient inheritance. . . .

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>It is
                        clear; it is plain; it is certain: God gave
                        ancient Canaan to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the twelve tribes of
                        Israel,
                        of whom the Ten Tribes are the dominant part. It is their land, in time
                        and in eternity. It is their land now whenever they are worthy to tread
                        its blessed surface. And it shall be theirs again in that everlasting
                        eternity
                        that lies ahead. "It is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth
                        shall inherit it," in that celestial day when it shall be crowned with
                        the presence of God, even the Father. (D&amp;C 88:17-19.) Where else,
                        then,
                        would we expect to see the Ten Tribes return? Where else would we
                        expect
                        them to assemble to worship the God of their fathers and to be
                        inheritors
                        of the promises made to the ancient ones whose seed they are?

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 80px;"><big><big>Thus it is
                        that we see why the revelations speak
                        of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth into the
                        Church
                        and kingdom of God on earth, and also of the leading of the Ten Tribes
                        from the land of the north back again to their promised Canaan. The
                        gathering
                        of Israel is one thing, the return of the Ten Tribes to a specified
                        place
                        is another; and Moses gave to men in our day the keys and power to
                        perform
                        both labors. This means that Israel is gathered at the direction and
                        pursuant
                        to the power and authority vested in the legal administrators who
                        preside
                        over The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And it also means
                        that the Ten Tribes -- scattered, lost, unknown, and now in all the
                        nations
                        of the earth -- these Ten Tribes, with their prophets, with their
                        scriptures,
                        in faith and desiring righteousness, shall return to blessed Canaan at
                        the direction of these same legal administrators. The President of the
                        Church is the only person on earth at any given time who does or can
                        exercise
                        these or any other priesthood keys in their eternal fulness. He will
                        direct
                        the return of the Ten Tribes. It will not come to pass in any other
                        way.

                        return

                        Coming
                        of Christ. Some shall no doubt return to Canaan as true believers and
                        members
                        of the true Church, with the intent and purpose of fulfilling the
                        scriptures
                        and building up the ancient cities of Israel. This may well happen in
                        some
                        small measure, and to it there can be no objection. Great movements

                        forecast when small rivulets trickle from the pent-up reservoirs. But
                        we
                        do say that the great day of the return of the Ten Tribes, the day when
                        the assembling hosts shall fulfill the prophetic promises, shall come
                        after

                        of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They are stake

                                Israel, have suffered greatly for their transgressions, and the

                                which were theirs by inheritance, based upon their faithfulness, have

                                and hated by all nations. Nevertheless the Lord has not forgotten them
                                nor the covenant he made with their fathers. The nations that oppressed
                                them have passed away, or are doomed to such a fate; but Israel is now
                                being gathered and the Lord is renewing his covenants with them.

                                they shall possess the land of their inheritance and the Lord will set

                            his hands wittingly," he placed his right hand upon Ephraim, "and he
                            blessed
                            Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did
                            walk,
                            the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which
                            redeemed
                            me from all evil, bless the lads," etc. Joseph was about to remove the
                            old man's hands, and bringing his right hand upon the head of the
                            oldest
                            boy, saying--"Not so, my father; for this is the first born; put thy
                            right
                            hand upon his head. And his father refused, and said, I know it, my
                            son,
                            I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great;
                            but
                            truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall
                            become a multitude of nations." Ephraim has become mixed with all the
                            nations
                            of the earth, and it is Ephraim that is gathering together.

                            It is Ephraim that I have been searching for all
                            the days of my preaching, and that is the blood which ran in my veins
                            when
                            I embraced the Gospel. If there are any of the other tribes of Israel
                            mixed
                            with the Gentiles we are also searching for them. Though the Gentiles
                            are
                            cut off, do not suppose that we are not going to preach the Gospel
                            among
                            the Gentile nations, for they are mingled with the house of Israel, and
                            when we send to the nations we do not seek for the Gentiles, because
                            they
                            are disobedient and rebellious. We want the blood of Jacob, and that of
                            his father Isaac and Abraham, which runs in the veins of the people.
                            There
                            is a particle of it here, and another there, blessing the nations as
                            predicted.

                            Take a family of ten children, for instance, and
                            you may find nine of them purely of the Gentile stock, and one son or
                            one
                            daughter in that family who is purely of the Blood of Ephraim. It was
                            in
                            the veins of the father or mother, and was reproduced in the son or
                            daughter,
                            while all the rest of the family are Gentiles. You may think that is
                            singular,
                            but it is true. It is the house of Israel we are after, and we care not
                            whether they come from the east, the west, the north, or the south;
                            from
                            China, Russia, England, California, North or South America, or some
                            other
                            locality; and it is the very lad on whom father Jacob laid his hands,
                            that
                            will save the house of Israel. The Book of Mormon came to Ephraim, for
                            Joseph Smith was a pure Ephraimite, and the Book of Mormon was revealed
                            to him, and while he lived he made it his business to search for those
                            who believed the Gospel.
                        </big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big><br>
                            Again, if a pure Gentile firmly believes the Gospel
                            of Jesus Christ, and yields obedience to it, in such a case I will give
                            you the words of the Prophet Joseph-- "When the Lord pours out the Holy
                            Ghost upon that individual he will have spasms, and you would think
                            that
                            he was going into fits."
                        </big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big><br>
                            Joseph said that the Gentile blood was actually
                            cleansed out of their veins, and the blood of Jacob made to circulate
                            in
                            them; and the revolution and change in the system were so great that it
                            caused the beholder to think they were going into fits.
                        </big></big><br style="font-family: arial;">
                    <big style="font-family: arial;"><big><br>
                            If any of the Gentiles will believe, we will lay
                            our hands upon them that they may receive the Holy Ghost, and the Lord
                            will make them of the house of Israel. They will be broken off from the
                            wild olive tree, and be grafted into the good and tame olive tree, and
                            will partake of its sap and fatness. If you take a bud and inoculate it
                            into another tree it ceases to receive nourishment from its original
                            stock;
                            it must, however, receive nourishment, or it will die. Where must it
                            receive
                            its nourishment from? From the tree into which it has been introduced;
                            it is supported by it, and becomes incorporated with it.

                            It is so with the House of Israel and the Gentile
                            nations; if the Gentiles are grafted into the good olive tree they will
                            partake of its root and fatness.

                            has chosen us from the various nations for this
                            purpose. There are men in this Church from almost every race of men,
                            and
                            if representatives from all the races are not now, they will be in. God
                            scattered the seed of Israel through all of the nations of the earth,
                            so
                            that in the great gathering of the last days He might be able to get
                            representatives
                            of all the families of men. And we are chosen for this purpose. The
                            seed
                            has been scattered among the nations; and when the descendants of
                            Israel
                            here, heard the sound of the Gospel, it was indeed the glad tidings of
                            salvation to them. They knew the voice of the shepherd, it was like
                            telling
                            them something they had forgotten but always knew; they felt that it
                            was
                            something they had been waiting for, the sound thereof was most
                            delightful
                            to the soul. . . It is true we have been scattered among Gentile
                            nations,
                            and are called Gentiles, but nevertheless we are of the pure seed,
                            having
                            come through Gentile lineage that we may be the means of saving them,
                            and
                            through our faithfulness we shall stand at their head. This is the
                            blessing
                            which rests upon us as descendants of Abraham. (<i>Journal of Discourses</i>,

                            Church is expanding at a tremendous rate. We
                            now have stakes of Zion in a great many countries of the world, and
                            most
                            stakes have at least one patriarch. This growth permits many people
                            across
                            the earth the privilege of receiving patriarchal blessings. As
                            President
                            Joseph Fielding Smith stated, "The great majority of those who become
                            members
                            of the Church are literal descendants of Abraham through Ephraim, son
                            of
                            Joseph"(Doctrines of Salvation, 3:246). However, Manasseh, the other
                            son
                            of Joseph, as well as the other sons of Jacob, has many descendants in
                            the Church. There may be some come into the Church in our day who are
                            not
                            of Jacob's blood lineage. No one need assume that he or she will be
                            denied
                            any blessing by reason of not being of the blood lineage of Israel. The
                            Lord told Abraham, "And I will bless them through thy name; for as many
                            as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be
                            accounted
                            thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father." (Abraham
                            2:10)
                        </span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            Nephi tells us
                            that "as many of the Gentiles as
                            will repent are the covenant people of the Lord."(2 Nephi 30:2)
                            Therefore
                            it makes no difference if the blessings of the house of Israel come by
                            lineage or by adoption.

                            Some might be
                            disturbed because members of the same
                            family have blessings declaring them to be of a different lineage. A
                            few
                            families are of a mixed lineage. We believe that the house of Israel
                            today
                            constitutes a large measure of the human family. Because the tribes
                            have
                            intermixed one with another, one child may be declared to be from the
                            tribe
                            of Ephraim and another of the same family from Manasseh or one of the
                            other
                            tribes. The blessing of one tribe, therefore, may be dominant in one
                            child,
                            and the blessing of another tribe dominant in yet another child. So
                            children
                            from the same parents could receive the blessings of different tribes.
