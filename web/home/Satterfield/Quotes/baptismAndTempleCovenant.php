                                    are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that
                                    stand in need of comfort, and
                                    to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all
                                    places that ye may be in, even until death" (Mosiah 18:8-9). Any

                                    end" (D&amp;C 20:37), need have no hesitancy in going to a holy temple
                                    and receiving, in connection with
