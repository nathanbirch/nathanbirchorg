                            basic doctrine of the Church.What I say is based on these
                            convictions:</span></big></big></p>
                <p><big><big><span style="font-family: arial;">
                            <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">First:</span> instruction vital to
                            our salvation is not hidden in an obscure verse or phrase in the
                            scriptures. To the contrary, essential truths are repeated over and
                            over again.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Second:</span> every verse,
                            whether oft-quoted or obscure, must be measured against other verses.
                            There are complementary and tempering teachings in the scriptures which
                            bring a balanced knowledge of truth.</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Next:</span> there is a
                            consistency in what the Lord says and what He does, that is evident in
                            all creation. Nature can teach valuable lessons about spiritual and
                            doctrinal matters. The Lord drew lessons from flowers and foxes, from
                            seeds and salt, and sparrows and sunsets.</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Fourth:</span> not all that God
                            has said is in the Bible. Other scriptures-the Book of Mormon, the
                            Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price-have equal
                            validity, and they sustain one another.</span><br
                            style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Fifth:</span> while much must be
                            taken on faith alone, there is individual revelation through which we
                            may know the truth. "There is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of
                            the Almighty giveth them understanding." (Job 32:8.) What may be
                            obscure in the scriptures can be made plain through the gift of the
                            Holy Ghost. We can have as full an understanding of spiritual things as
                            we are willing to earn.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
                            <span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">And I add one more conviction:</span>
                            there is an adversary who has his own channels of spiritual
                            communication. He confuses the careless and prompts those who serve him
                            to devise deceptive, counterfeit doctrine, carefully contrived to
                            appear genuine.</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
                        <span style="font-family: arial;">I mention this because now, as
                            always, there are self-appointed spokesmen who scoff at what we believe
                            and misrepresent what we teach.&nbsp; <small>("The Pattern of Our
