                        But faith is not only the principle of
                        action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven
                        or on earth. Thus says the author of the epistle to
                        the Hebrews, 11:3 -- </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big> "Through
                        faith we understand that the worlds were framed

                        understand that the principle of power which
                        existed in the bosom of God, by which the worlds were framed, was
                        faith; and that it is by reason of
                        this principle of power existing in the Deity, that all created things
                        exist; so that all things in heaven, on earth, or under the earth exist
                        by reason of faith as it

                        been for the principle of faith the worlds
                        would never have been framed neither would man have been formed of the
                        dust. It is the principle by
                        which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power over all
                        temporal as well as eternal things. Take this principle or attribute --
                        for it is an attribute -- from the Deity, and he would cease to exist.

                        Faith, then, is the first great

                        things; by it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they
                        are changed, or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of God.
                        Without it there is no power, and without power there could be no

                        The author of the epistle to the
                        Hebrews, in the eleventh chapter of that epistle and first verse, gives

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big> "Now faith
                        is the substance (assurance) of things hoped

                        we learn that faith is the assurance which men
                        have of the existence of things which they have not seen, and the
                        principle of action in all intelligent.

                        Let us here observe, that three things
                        are necessary in order that any rational and intelligent being may
                        exercise faith in God unto life and salvation.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big> First, the
                        idea that he actually exists.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big> Secondly,
                        a correct idea of his character, perfections,

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big> Thirdly,
                        an actual knowledge that the course of life
                        which he is pursuing is according to his will. For without an
                        acquaintance with these three important
                        facts, the faith of every rational being must be imperfect and
                        unproductive; but with this understanding it can become perfect and
                        fruitful, abounding in
                        righteousness, unto the praise and glory of God the Father, and the

                        will of our Heavenly Father.
                        Without all three--first, absolute confidence; second, action; and

                        must have confidence in that which we cannot
                        see. . . .</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Second, for
                        our faith to make a difference, we must act.
                        We must do all that is in our power to change passive belief into
                        active faith, for truly, "faith, if it hath
                        not works, is dead" (James 2:17). </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>In 1998,
                        President Gordon B. Hinckley raised a voice of
                        warning to the Saints of this Church as well as to the world at large.
                        He uttered that same warning last
                        night at priesthood meeting. He said: "I am suggesting that the time
                        has come to get our houses in order. So many people are living on the
                        very edge of their
                        incomes. In fact, some are living on borrowings. . . . I am troubled by
                        the huge consumer installment debt which hangs over the people of the
                        nation, including
                        our own people" ("To the Boys and to the Men," <em>Ensign</em>, Nov.
                        1998, 53; <em>Liahona,</em>
                        Jan. 1999, 65). </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Brothers
                        and sisters, when these prophetic words were
                        uttered, some faithful members of the Church mustered their faith and
                        heeded the counsel of the prophet.
                        They are profoundly grateful today that they did. Others perhaps
                        believed that what the prophet said was true but lacked faith, even as
                        small as a grain of
                        mustard seed. Consequently, some have suffered financial, personal, and
                        family distress. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Third,
                        one's faith should be consistent with the will of
                        our Heavenly Father, including His laws of nature. The sparrow flying
                        into a hurricane may believe that
                        he can successfully navigate the storm, but the unforgiving natural law
                        will convince him otherwise in the end. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Are we
                        wiser than the sparrow? Often what passes for faith
                        in this world is little more than gullibility. It is distressing to see
                        how eager some people are to
                        embrace fads and theories while rejecting or giving less credence and
                        attention to the everlasting principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
                        It is distressing how
                        eagerly some rush into foolish or unethical behavior, believing that
                        God will somehow deliver them from the inevitable tragic consequences
                        of their actions.
                        They even go so far as to ask for the blessings of heaven, knowing in
                        their hearts that what they do is contrary to the will of our Father in
                        Heaven. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>How do we
                        know when our faith conforms to the will of our
                        Heavenly Father and He approves of that which we seek? We must know the
                        word of God. One of
                        the reasons we immerse ourselves in the scriptures is to know of
                        Heavenly Father's dealings with man from the beginning. If the desires
                        of our heart are
                        contrary to scripture, then we should not pursue them further. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Next, we
                        must heed the counsel of latter-day prophets as
                        they give inspired instruction. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Additionally,
                        we must ponder and pray and seek the
                        guidance of the Spirit. If we do so, the Lord has promised, "I will
                        tell you in your mind and in your heart,
                        by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in
                        your heart" (D&amp;C 8:2). </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Only when
                        our faith is aligned with the will of our
                        Heavenly Father will we be empowered to receive the blessings we seek.

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>My first
                        point on the subject of timing is that the Lord
                        has His own timetable. "My words are sure and shall not fail," the Lord
                        taught the early elders of this
                        dispensation. "But," He continued, "all things must come to pass in
                        their time" (D&amp;C 64:31--32). </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>The first
                        principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord
                        Jesus Christ. Faith means trust--trust in God's will, trust in His way
                        of doing things, and trust in His
                        timetable. We should not try to impose our timetable on His. . . .
                        Indeed, we cannot have true faith in the Lord without also having
                        complete trust in His will
                        and in His timing. . . . </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>The Lord's
                        timing also applies to the important events of
                        our personal lives. A great scripture in the Doctrine and Covenants
                        declares that a particular spiritual
                        experience will come to us "in his own time, and in his own way, and
                        according to his own will" (D&amp;C 88:68). This principle applies to
                        revelation (see Oaks,
                        "Teaching and Learning by the Spirit,"<em> Ensign</em>, March 1997, 11)
                        and to all of the most important events in our lives: birth, marriage,
                        death, and even our moves
                        from place to place. . . .</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>It is not
                        enough that we are under call, or even that we
                        are going in the right direction. The timing must be right, and if the
                        time is not right, our actions should
                        be adjusted to the Lord's timetable as revealed by His servants. . . .</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Someone has
                        said that life is what happens to us while we
                        are making other plans. Because of things over which we have no
                        control, we cannot plan and bring
                        to pass everything we desire in our lives. Many important things will
                        occur in our lives that we have not planned, and not all of them will
                        be welcome. The
                        tragic events of September 11th and their revolutionary consequences
                        provide an obvious example. Even our most righteous desires may elude
                        us, or come in
                        different ways or at different times than we have sought to plan. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>For
                        example, we cannot be sure that we will marry as soon
                        as we desire. A marriage that is timely in our view may be our blessing
                        or it may not. . . </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>The timing
                        of marriage is perhaps the best example of an
                        extremely important event in our lives that is almost impossible to
                        plan. Like other important mortal
                        events that depend on the agency of others or the will and timing of
                        the Lord, marriage cannot be anticipated or planned with certainty. We
                        can and should
                        work for and pray for our righteous desires, but, despite this, many
                        will remain single well beyond their desired time for marriage. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>So what
                        should be done in the meantime? Faith in the Lord
                        Jesus Christ prepares us for whatever life brings. This kind of faith
                        prepares us to deal with life's
                        opportunities--to take advantage of those that are received and to
                        persist through the disappointments of those that are lost. In the
                        exercise of that faith we
                        should commit ourselves to the priorities and standards we will follow
                        on matters we do not control and persist faithfully in those
                        commitments whatever
                        happens to us because of the agency of others or the timing of the
                        Lord. When we do this, we will have a constancy in our lives that will
                        give us direction and
                        peace. Whatever the circumstances beyond our control, our commitments
                        and standards can be constant. . . .</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Wise are
                        those who make this commitment: <em>I will put
                            the Lord first in my life and I will keep His commandments.</em> The
                        performance of that commitment is
                        within everyone's control. We can fulfill that commitment without
                        regard to what others decide to do, and that commitment will anchor us
                        no matter what
                        timing the Lord directs for the most important events in our lives. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Do you see
                        the difference between committing to what <em>you
                            will do,</em> in contrast to trying to plan that you will be married by
                        the time you graduate or that you
                        will earn at least X amount of dollars on your first job?</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>If we have
                        faith in God and if we are committed to the
                        fundamentals of keeping His commandments and putting Him first in our
                        lives, we do not need to plan
                        every single event--even every important event--and we should not feel
                        rejected or depressed if some things--even some very important
                        things--do not happen at
                        the time we had planned or hoped or prayed. </big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Commit
                        yourself to put the Lord first in your life, keep
                        His commandments, and do what the Lord's servants ask you to do. Then
                        your feet are on the pathway
                        to eternal life. Then it does not matter whether you are called to be a
                        bishop or a Relief Society president, whether you are married or
                        single, or whether you die
                        tomorrow. You do not know what will happen. Do your best on what is
                        fundamental and personal and then trust in the Lord and His timing.

                        Which comes first faith or
                        knowledge? Is faith a vague and uncertain hope in something unseen
                        that, as a sprouting seed, may grow into knowledge?
                        Or is faith based on truth and knowledge? Is faith something that grows
                        out of and comes because of a prior knowledge of the truth?</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big><strong>Answers</strong>:
                        Faith is the child of knowledge.
                        It is reserved for those only who first have knowledge; there neither
                        is nor can be any faith until there is knowledge.
                        No one can have faith in a God of whom he knows nothing. Faith is
                        founded on truth; it is the offspring of truth; it can never exist
                        alone and apart from the
                        truth. No one can have faith unto life and salvation in a false god; no
                        idol ever had power to raise the dead or stop the sun. And faith is
                        power. It is true that
                        faith in some doctrine or on some theological point may be imperfect;
                        it is true that sproutings of either faith or knowledge can become
                        perfect relative to that
                        doctrine or concept. But faith itself - the great and eternal power
                        that creates and governs and saves, faith unto life and salvation -
                        saving faith grows out of
                        knowledge and cannot come in any other way.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>"Faith
                        cometh by hearing," Paul says, "and hearing the
                        word of God" taught by the power of the Holy Ghost. (Romans 10:17.)
                        Faith comes to those only who
                        receive the word of truth. Hence the gospel truism that "it pleased God
                        by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe." (1
                        Corinthians 1:21.) The
                        gospel embraces all truth, and truth - nothing else -- can bring
                        salvation. Thus Alma says, "If ye have faith ye hope for things which
                        are not seen, which are
                        true." (Alma 32:21.) Indeed, faith is a hope in that which is not seen
                        that is true, and there can be no faith in an unseen thing that is
                        false. There is no power in
                        falsehood. No one can have faith unto life and salvation in a god who
                        is believed to be a spirit nothingness, or in a doctrine that denies
                        the resurrection, or in a
                        philosophy that postulates man's evolutionary evolvement from lower
                        forms of life, or in anything that is not true.</big></big></p>

                        diamond truth, is the rock foundation upon which

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>How do men
                        exercise faith? If they have an occasion to
                        heal the sick, raise the dead or move mountains, how is it done? Faith
                        is power, but what causes the
                        power to flow forth and accomplish the desired result? As an
                        introductory explanation, the account we are studying asks: "What are
                        we to understand by a
                        man's working by faith?"</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>By way of
                        answer, the account says: "We understand that
                        when a man works by faith he works by mental exertion instead of
                        physical force. It is by words,
                        instead of exerting his physical powers, with which every being works
                        when he works by faith. God said, `Let there be light: and there was
                        light.' Joshua spake
                        and the great lights which God had created stood still. Elijah
                        commanded, and the heavens were stayed for the space of three years and
                        six months, so that it did
                        not rain: he again commanded and the heavens gave forth rain. All this
                        was done by faith. And the Saviour says: `If you have faith as a grain
                        of mustard seed,
                        say to this mountain, "Remove," and it will remove; or say to that
                        sycamine tree, "Be ye plucked up, and planted in the midst of the sea,"
                        and it shall obey you.'
                        Faith, then, works by words; and with these its mightiest works have
                        been, and will be performed." (Lectures on Faith 7:3.)</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>But working
                        by faith is not the mere speaking of a few
                        well-chosen words; anyone with the power of speech could have commanded
                        the rotting corpse of
                        Lazarus to come forth, but only one whose power was greater than death
                        could bring life again to the brother of Mary and Martha. Nor is
                        working by faith
                        merely a mental desire, however strong, that some eventuality should
                        occur. There may be those whose mental powers and thought processes are
                        greater than
                        any of the saints, but only persons who are in tune with the Infinite
                        can exercise the spiritual forces and powers that come from him.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Those who
                        work by faith must first have faith; no one can
                        use a power that he does not possess, and the faith or power must be
                        gained by obedience to those
                        laws upon which its receipt is predicated. These we have set forth.
                        Those who work by faith must believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and in
                        his Father. They must
                        accept at face value what the revealed word teaches as to the
                        character, attributes, and perfections of the Father and the Son. They
                        must then work the works of
                        righteousness until they know within themselves that their way of life
                        conforms to the divine will, and they must be willing to lay their all
                        on the altar of the
                        Almighty.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>And then --
                        when the day is at hand and the hour has
                        arrived for the miracle to be wrought -- then they must be in tune with
                        the Holy Spirit of God. He who is
                        the Author of faith, he whose power faith is, he whose works are the
                        embodiment of justice and judgment and wisdom and all good things, even
                        he must
                        approve the use of his power in the case at hand. Faith cannot be
                        exercised contrary to the order of heaven or contrary to the will and
                        purposes of him whose
                        power it is. Men work by faith when they are in tune with the Spirit
                        and when what they seek to do by mental exertion and by the spoken word
                        is the mind and
                        will of the Lord. (Bruce R. McConkie, <em>A New Witness for the

                    </big></big>
                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><big><strong>Marion G. Romney</strong></big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>It is also
                        clear from the scriptures that one must pray in
                        faith. It is apparent that there is a direct relationship between the
                        strength of one's faith and the
                        effectiveness of his prayer. There is, however, a principle associated
                        with this matter of faith that we should all understand. I used to feel
                        that if I could
                        develop enough faith, I could receive in every instance exactly what I
                        prayed for. This belief was based upon such scriptures as Matthew
                        17:20, in which Jesus
                        said to his disciples, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye
                        shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it
                        shall remove; and
                        nothing shall be impossible unto you." But at that time I had not
                        learned that this promise was made upon the implied condition that
                        one's request be made in
                        harmony with the <em>will</em> <em>of God.</em></big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>We learned
                        this principle in our home through a rather
                        trying experience. During the early years of our married life, my wife
                        and I intensely desired a particular
                        blessing that we thought would be a great blessing, and we set about to
                        obtain it by faith. We asked, we believed, we thought we had faith, but
                        though we
                        fasted often and prayed fervently, the years rolled by without bringing
                        us the object of our prayers.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>Finally we
                        concluded that there must be something that we
                        had not fully understood. Further research and prayerful study of the
                        scriptures revealed the fact that
                        we were not giving proper consideration to the will of the Lord, that
                        we were concentrating our faith and prayers solely upon receiving the
                        particular thing
                        which by predetermination we had set our hearts upon. We had to
                        reconsider the conditions of the promise. We found that Jesus had
                        stated them in full in
                        several places. For example, to the Nephites he said, ". . . whatsoever
                        ye shall ask the Father in my name, <em>which is right, </em>believing
                        that ye shall receive, behold
                        it shall be given you." (3 Nephi 18:20. Italics added.) In the light of
                        this and other scriptures, we came to realize that pending the time we
                        could know what is
                        right and what is expedient, we had to learn to be as earnest in
                        praying "if it be thy will" as we were in presenting our request.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>We further
                        learned that the time will come when we shall
                        know the will of God before we ask, and then everything for which we
                        pray will be right and
                        expedient. And that will be when, as a result of righteous living, we
                        shall so enjoy the companionship of the Holy Spirit that he will
                        dictate what we ask. On
                        this point the Lord has said:</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>"And if ye
                        are purified and cleansed from all sin, ye
                        shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of Jesus and it shall be done.</big></big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big><big>"But know
                        this, it shall be given you what you shall ask."

                        Father is an eternal being. The very name of the
                        kind of life he lives is eternal life, and thus eternal life consists
                        in living and being as he is. In other
                        words, eternal life is to gain the power of God, which power is faith,
                        and thus to be able to do what he does and to live as he lives. And the
                        great and eternal
                        plan of salvation that he has ordained and established consists of
                        those laws, ordinances, and powers whereby faith is acquired and
                        perfected until it is
                        possessed in the same degree and to the same extent that it exists in
                        Deity. Faith will thus dwell independently in every person who gains
