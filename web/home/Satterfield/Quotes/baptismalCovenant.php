                        the doctrine as taught by
                        the Lord. During His ministry, Jesus taught that baptism is necessary
                        for salvation. "Except a man be born of water and
                        of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5).
                        Baptism is the first of the saving ordinances. When we are baptized, we
                        covenant that we
                        will take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and serve Him and keep His
                        commandments. ("The Aaronic Priesthood and the Sacrament," <em>Ensign</em>,

                    has made a covenant with the Lord to keep his commandments. We are to
                    serve the Lord with all the heart, and all the
                    mind, and all the strength that we have, and that too in the name of
                    Jesus Christ. Everything that we do should be done in the name of Jesus
                    Christ.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>In the waters of
                    baptism, we covenanted
                    that we would keep these commandments; that we would serve the Lord;
                    that we would keep this first and greatest of
                    all commandments, and love the Lord our God; that we would keep the
                    next great commandment, we would love our neighbor as ourselves; and
                    with all the
                    might that we have, with all the strength, with all our hearts, we
                    would prove to him that we would "live by every word that proceedeth
                    forth from the mouth of
                    God"; that we would be obedient and humble, diligent in his service,
                    willing to obey, to hearken to the counsels of those who preside over
                    us and do all things

                        soul baptized, truly baptized, has
                        humbled himself; his heart is broken; his spirit is contrite; he has
                        made a covenant before God that he will keep his
                        commandments, and he has forsaken all his sins. Then after he gets into
                        the Church, is it his privilege to sin after he is in? Can he let down?
                        Can he indulge in
                        some of the things which the Lord has said he should avoid? No, it is
                        just as necessary that he have that contrite spirit, that broken heart,
                        after he is baptized as
                        it is before. (<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>, 2:328)</big><big><br

                    might be recounted. Alma, at the waters of Mormon, summarized them by
                    having each repentant soul swear in substance and thought content:</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(a) to forsake
                    the world, to repent of
                    all his or her sins, to join the true church, "to come into the fold of
                    God."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(b) to become a
                    saint, to be numbered
                    with the true believers, to take upon me the name of Christ and become
                    one of his family, "and to be called [one of] his
                    people."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(c) to love and
                    serve his fellowmen, to
                    esteem others as himself, and to bear the burdens of his brethren in
                    the church `that they may be light."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(d) to visit the
                    fatherless and the
                    widows in their afflictions, to care for the sick, the helpless, and
                    the bereaved, and "to mourn with those that mourn."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(e) to proclaim
                    peace, to spread solace,
                    and to "comfort those that stand in need of comfort."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(f) to preach
                    the gospel, to raise the
                    warning voice, to call sinners to repentance, and to stand as a witness
                    of Christ "at all times and in all things, and in all
                    places ... even until death."</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(g) to serve the
                    Lord "and keep his
                    commandments" - a promise that is itself infinite and endless, and is
                    so worded as to embrace conformity to every word that
                    proceedeth forth from the mouth of God. </big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>On his part, as
                    Alma expresses it, <u>the
                        Lord promises</u> that those who love and serve him shall receive such
                    great blessings as these:</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(a) He covenants
                    to baptize them with
                    fire and with the Holy Ghost, to give them the companionship of his
                    Holy Spirit, to "pour out his Spirit more abundantly
                    upon" them.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(b) He covenants
                    that his saints shall
                    be redeemed -- redeemed from death, hell, the devil, and endless
                    torment; redeemed temporally and spiritually; redeemed
                    from their spiritual fall so that, having been raised in immortality,
                    they will return to his presence and be inheritors of eternal glory.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(c) He covenants
                    that they shall "be
                    numbered with those of the first resurrection," that they shall come
                    forth in the resurrection of the just, that they shall rise
                    from death with a celestial body, which can stand the glory of the
                    celestial kingdom.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>(d) He covenants
                    that they shall have
                    eternal life which is to inherit, receive, and possess the fulness of
                    the glory of the celestial world. It is to be like God.

                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>To be baptized
                    is to enter into a
                    covenant of commission. But to fail to be baptized when one is
                    convinced the work is divine is a sin of omission, and penalties
                    will be assessed for failure to meet this requirement. Tens of
                    thousands of people having heard the gospel have failed to be baptized,
                    giving trivial excuses. This
                    is a most serious sin. The Lord told Nicodemus that he and others would
                    not even see the kingdom of God if they rejected the required baptism.</big></p>
                <p style="font-family: arial; margin-left: 40px;"><big>The covenants we
                    make with God involve
                    promises to do, not merely to refrain from doing, to work righteousness
                    as well as to avoid evil. The children of
                    Israel made such covenants through Moses, saying, "All that the Lord
                    hath spoken we will do" (Exodus 19:8, italics added), though hardly was
                    Moses' back
                    turned until they had broken their promise through wrongdoing. In the
                    baptismal waters we give a similar undertaking and we repledge it in
                    the ordinance of the
                    sacrament. Not to honor these pledges, to refuse to serve or to accept
                    responsibility and do less than one's best at it, is a sin of omission.

                        a covenant. Baptism for the remission of sins is
                        a covenant. When this ordinance was revealed in this dispensation, the
                        Lord called it "a new and an everlasting covenant, even that which was
                        from the
                        beginning." This covenant was given in the beginning
                        and was lost to men through apostasy, therefore, when it was revealed
                        again, it became to man a new covenant,
                        although it was from the beginning, and it is everlasting since its
                        effects upon the individual endure forever. Then again, whenever there
                        is need for repentance,
                        baptism is the method, or law, given of the Lord by which the remission
                        of sins shall come, and so this law is everlasting. (<em>Doctrines of

                        is the new and everlasting
                        covenant? I regret to say that there are some members of the Church who
                        are misled and misinformed in regard to what the new
                        and everlasting covenant really is. The new and everlasting covenant is
                        the sum total of all gospel covenants and obligations, and I want to
                        prove it. In the 66th
                        section of the Doctrine and Covenants, verse 2, I read: "Verily I say
                        unto you, blessed are you
                        for receiving mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness of my gospel,
                        sent forth unto the children of men, that they
                        might have life and be made partakers of the glories which are to be
                        revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets and
                        apostles in days of old." &nbsp;</big><big>More definitely stated is
                        the definition
                        of the new and everlasting covenant given to us in section 132 of the
                        Doctrine and Covenants. Now I am going to say
                        before I read this that marriage is not the new and everlasting
                        covenant. If there are any here that have that idea I want to say that
                        right to them. Baptism is not
                        the new and everlasting covenant. Ordination to the priesthood is not
                        the new and everlasting covenant. In section 22 of the Doctrine and
                        Covenants the Lord
                        says that baptism is "a new and an everlasting covenant, even that
                        which was from the beginning." Marriage in the temple of the Lord for
                        time and for eternity
                        is "a" new and everlasting covenant. (<em>Doctrines of Salvation</em>,

                    a member of the Church,
                    is in the congregation, we do not forbid him partaking of it, but would
                    properly advise that the sacrament is for the
                    renewing of covenants. And, since he has not made the true covenant of
                    baptism or temple covenant, he is exempt. However, his partaking of the
                    sacrament if
                    he is clean and worthy and devout would not bring upon him any
                    condemnation as it would for those who have made solemn covenants and
                    then have ignored
                    or defied them. (<em>The Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball</em>, p.226)</big></p>

                        we went forth into the waters of
                        baptism and covenanted with our Father in heaven to serve Him and keep
                        His commandments, He bound Himself also
                        by covenant to us that He would never desert us, never leave us to
                        ourselves, never forget us, that in the midst of trials and hardships,
                        when everything was
                        arrayed against us, He would be near unto us and would sustain us. That
                        was His covenant, and He has amply fulfilled it up to the present time
                        and has shown
                        that we can tie to the promises that He has made. We have proved these
                        things through experience. (<em>Gospel Truth</em>, p.134)</big><span

                    only one of the rounds
                    in the Gospel ladder which reaches from the depth of the degradation
                    into which poor humanity has fallen to the Celestial
                    Kingdom of God. But the poor prisoner who wishes to escape from his
                    dungeon must take step after step up the ladder until he reaches the
                    top and can breathe
                    once more the free air of heaven, or he will not be benefited; the
                    ladder is his means for attaining the desired end--liberty. The Gospel
                    is our means of gaining
                    our important end--salvation. But we must obey every principle, or we
                    cannot be saved; we must take every step up the ladder, or we cannot
                    get into the
                    Celestial Kingdom. The moment we set bounds to our faith and works,
                    that moment our salvation ceases. . . .</big></p>

                    justified in neglecting
                    a present duty in order to be better able, as he thinks, to perform a
                    future one. No man can be depended on to do his duty
                    in another sphere or position in life if he does not do so in the one
                    he at present occupies. We must keep our path clear as we go. Let the
                    pages of our lives be
                    free from blot or stain every day, or else the record of our folly and
                    neglect of duty may stare us in the face some day when we shall
                    bitterly regret having given
                    way to such weaknesses. (<em>Gospel Truth, p. </em>135</big><span
