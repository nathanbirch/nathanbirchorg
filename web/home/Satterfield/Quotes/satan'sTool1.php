                                        so many fascinating, exciting
                                        things to do, or so many challenges pressing upon you, that it is hard
                                        to keep focused on that which is essential?&nbsp; When things of the
                                        world crowd in, all too often the wrong things are allowed to take
                                        highest priority.&nbsp; Then it is easy to forget the fundamental
                                        purpose of life.&nbsp; Satan has a powerful tool to use against good
                                        people, those who are committed to a worthy, righteous life, who want
                                        to do good and intend to make the most of this life.&nbsp; His tool is <span

                                        extensive array of undeniably good things that are used to keep us from
                                        doing the essential ones. &nbsp; Have you noticed that when you begin
                                        to focus on something truly important, something of eternal
                                        significance, there often come throughts of other good things to
                                        distract you?&nbsp; Satan promotes, distraction.&nbsp; He would have
                                        good people fill life with "good things" so there is no room for the
                                        "essential ones."&nbsp; Have you unconsciously&nbsp; been caught in

                                                    should begin by recognizing the reality that just because something is
                                                    good is not a sufficient reason for doing it.&nbsp; The number of good
                                                    things we can do far exceeds the time available to accomplish
                                                    them.&nbsp;
                                                    Some things are better than good, and these are the things that should
                                                    command priority attention in our lives.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; As we consider
                                                    various
                                                    choices, we should remember that it is not enough that something is
                                                    good. Other choices are better, and still others are best. Even though
                                                    a particular choice is more costly, its far greater value may make it
                                                    the best choice of all.&nbsp; Consider how we use our time in the
                                                    choices we make in viewing television, playing video games, surfing the
                                                    Internet, or reading books or magazines. Of course it is good to view
                                                    wholesome entertainment or to obtain interesting information. But not
                                                    everything of that sort is worth the portion of our life we give to
                                                    obtain it. Some things are better, and others are best.</span>&nbsp; <small>("Good,
