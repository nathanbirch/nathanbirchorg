                                that these
                                small matters amount to but little, but sometimes it happens that out
                                of a small matter grows something exceedingly great.&nbsp; For
                                instance, while the Saints were living in Far West, there were two
                                sisters wishing to make cheese, and, neither of them possessing the
                                requisite number of cows, they agreed to exchange milk.<br>
                                <br>
                                The wife of Thomas B. Marsh, who was then President of the Twelve
                                Apostles, and sister Harris concluded they would exchange milk, in
                                order to make a little larger cheese than they otherwise could.&nbsp;
                                To be sure to have justice done, it was agreed that they should not
                                save the strippings, but that the milk and strippings should all go
                                together.&nbsp; Small matters to talk about here, to be sure, two
                                women's exchanging milk to make cheese.<br>
                                <br>
                                Mrs. Harris, it appeared, was faithful to the agreement and carried to
                                Mrs. Marsh the milk and strippings, but Mrs. Marsh, wishing to make
                                some extra good cheese, saved a pint of strippings from each cow and
                                sent Mrs. Harris the milk without the strippings.<br>
                                <br>
                                Finally it leaked out that Mrs. Marsh had saved strippings, and it
                                became a matter to be settled by the Teachers.&nbsp; They began to
                                examine the matter, and it was proved that Mrs. Marsh had saved the
                                strippings, and consequently had wronged Mrs. harris out of that amount.<br>
                                <br>
                                An appeal was taken from the Teacher to the Bishop, and a regular
                                Church trial was had.&nbsp; President Marsh did not consider that the
                                Bishop had done him and his lady justice, for they decided that the
                                strippings were wrongfully saved, and that the woman had violated her
                                covenant.<br>
                                <br>
                                Marsh immediately took an appeal to the High Council, who investigated
                                the question with much patience, and I assure you they were a grave
                                body. Marsh being extremely anxious to maintain the character of his
                                wife, as he was the President of the Twelve Apostles, and a great man
                                in Israel, made a desperate defence, but the High Council finally
                                confirmed the Bishop's decision.<br>
                                <br>
                                Marsh, not being satisfied, took an appeal to the First Presidency of
                                the Church, and Joseph and his Counsellors had to sit upon the case,
                                and they approved the decision of the High Council.<br>
                                <br>
                                This little affair, you will observe, kicked up a considerable breeze,
                                and Thomas B. Marsh then declared that he would sustain the character
                                of his wife, even if he had to go to hell for it.<br>
                                <br>
                                The then President of the Twelve Apostles, the man who should have been
                                the first to do justice and cause reparation to be made for wrong,
                                committed by any member of his family, took that position, and what
                                next?&nbsp; He went before a magistrate and swore that the "Mormons"
                                were hostile towards the State of Missouri.<br>
                                <br>
                                That affidavit brought from the government of Missouri an exterminating
                                order, which drove some 15,000 Saints from their homes and habitations,
                                and some thousands perished through suffering the exposure consequent
                                on this state of affairs.<br>
                                <br>
                                Do you understand what trouble was consequent to the dispute about a
                                pint of strippings?&nbsp; Do you understand that the want of fences
                                around gardens, fields, and yards, in town and country, allowing cattle
                                to get into mischief and into the stray pen, may end in some serious
                                result?&nbsp; That the corroding influence of such circumstances may be
                                brought to bear upon us, in such a way that we may lose the Spirit of
                                the Almighty and become hostile to the people?&nbsp; And if we should
                                not bring about as mighty results as the pint of strippings, yet we
                                might bring entire destruction to ourselves.&nbsp; If you wish to enjoy
                                your religion and the Spirit of the Almighty, you must make your
                                calculations to avoid annoyances, as much as possible.</big></font><br>

                                Whitmer, and so did Thomas B. Marsh.&nbsp; About the time he was
                                preparing to leave this Church, he received a revelation in the
                                Printing Office.&nbsp; He retired to himself, and prayed, and was
                                humble, and God gave him a revelation, and he wrote it.&nbsp; There
                                were from three to five pages of it; and when he came out, he read it
                                to brother Brigham and me.&nbsp; In it God told him what to do, and
                                that was to sustain brother Joseph and to believe that what brother
                                Joseph had said was true.&nbsp; But no; he took a course to sustain his
                                wife and oppose the Prophet of God, and she led him away.</big></font><br>

                                    Church whom I have injured O Bretheren once Bretheren!! How can I leave
                                    this world without your forgiveness Can I have it Can I have it?
                                    Something seems to say within yes O then hasten and signify it by

                                    Harris, wife of George W. Harris], and when that was accomplished I was
                                    so overjoyed that I was constrained to say in my heart truely this is
                                    an evidence that the Lord loves me after all my rebellion &amp; my
                                    sins. I know what I have done a mision was laid upon me &amp; I have
                                    never filled it and now I fear it is too late but it is by another, I
                                    see, the Lord could get along very well without me and He has lost
                                    nothing by my falling out of the ranks; But O what have I lost?! Riches
                                    Greater Riches than all this world or many planets like this could
                                    afford but O bretheren; can you speak one word of comfort to me Can I
                                    be saved at all in the Kingdom of God Can I find peace among you O if I
                                    can but enjoy your smiles and the smil[e]s of the Church &amp; of Jesus
                                    I shall be content to depart or remain in so great peace the Lord has
                                    been mindful of me and altho I was very stubborn He has followed me up

                            into my office and wished to know whether I could be reconciled to him,
                            and whether there could be a reconciliation between himself and the
                            Church of the living God.&nbsp; He reflected for a moment and said, I
                            am reconciled to the Church, but I want to know whether the Church can
                            be reconciled to me.<br>

                        very much weakened of late years by the afflicting rod of Jehovah. He
                        loved
                        me too much to let me go without whipping. I have seen the hand of the

                        secure, but to take heed lest they also should fall; for I had no

                        Spirit?"
                        I became jealous of the Prophet, and then I saw double, and overlooked
                        everything that was right, and spent all my time in looking for the
                        evil;
                        and then, when the Devil began to lead me, it was easy for the carnal
                        mind
                        to rise up, which is anger, jealousy, and wrath. I could feel it within
                        me; I felt angry and wrathful; and the Spirit of the Lord being gone,
                        as
                        the Scriptures say, I was blinded, and I thought I saw a beam in
                        brother
                        Joseph's eye, but it was nothing but a mote, and my own eye was filled
                        with the beam; but I thought I saw a beam in his, and I wanted to get
                        it
                        out; and, as brother Heber says, I got mad, and I wanted everybody else
                        to be mad. I talked with Brother Brigham and Brother Heber, and I
                        wanted
                        them to be mad like myself; and I saw they were not mad, and I got
                        madder
                        still because they were not. Brother Brigham, with a cautious look,
                        said,
                        "Are you the leader of the Church, brother Thomas?" I answered, "No."
                        "Well
                        then," said he, "Why do you not let that alone?"</big></font>

                <p style="font-family: arial;"><big><font size="+1"><big>Well, this is
                        about the amount of my hypocrisy--I
                        meddled
                        with that which was not my business. But let me tell you, my brethren
                        and
                        friends, if you do not want to suffer in body and mind, as I have
                        done,--if
                        there are any of you that have the seeds of apostacy in you, do not let
                        them make their appearance, but nip that spirit in the bud; for it is
                        misery
                        and affliction in this world, and destruction in the world to come. I
                        know
                        that I was a very stiff-necked man, and I felt, for the first four or
                        five
                        years especially, that I would never return to the Church; but towards
                        the latter part of the time, I began to wake up and to be sensible that
                        I was being chastised by the Almighty; and I felt to realize the
                        language
                        of Jeremiah concerning Ephraim in the last days, where he says, "Is
                        Ephraim
                        my dear son? Is he a pleasant child? For since I spake against him, I
                        do
                        earnestly remember him still; therefore my bowels are troubled for him;
                        I will surely have mercy on him, saith the Lord."</big></font>

                        language suits my condition. I then
                        thought,
                        I will go back and see if the Lord will heal me, for I am of the seed
                        of
                        Ephraim, and I felt troubled from that day, and my soul was vexed with
                        the filthy conversation of those Sodomites. . . .</big></font>

                        Florence, or Winter Quarters, where I
                        had
                        to stay, waiting for an opportunity to cross the Plains, I read many of
                        the publications and works of the Church, and became strengthened and
                        informed
                        in regard to the Priesthood of the Son of God. Although I knew
                        something
                        about the Priesthood before, so far as the theory was concerned, yet I
                        discovered that I had never properly understood it; and hence I feel
                        that
                        my faith is greatly strengthened. I wanted to get posted up and see
                        what
                        the "Mormons" had learned since I left them; and I learned very much by
                        reading the discourses that had been preached here.&nbsp; </big></font><font

                                    style="font-weight: bold;">Brigham Young</span>: A portion of the
                                congregation have heard what brother Marsh has said; but he spoke so
                                low that you could not all hear.&nbsp; He wants to know whether this
                                people are willing to receive him into full fellowship.&nbsp; When he
                                came to Florence, he applied to brother Cunningham, who was then
                                presiding there, for baptism.&nbsp; Brother Cunningham at first refused
                                to baptise him, probably thinking that it would be better for him to
                                wait till he came to this place; but he afterwards gave his consent to
                                brother Marsh's being baptised.&nbsp; Brother Marsh now wishes to be
                                received into full fellowship, and to be again baptised here.<br>

                                There are many here who have formerly been acquainted with him--with
                                his moral character, and they can judge as well as myself.&nbsp; Those
                                who are not acquainted with him will be willing to coincide with the
                                judgment of those who once knew him.<br>
                                <br>
                                I shall call a vote, to ascertain whether the people are willing that
                                he should be baptised into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                                Saints, and be acknowledged a member in full fellowship.&nbsp; I wish
                                those who are willing to receive brother Marsh into full fellowship as
                                a member in this Church and kingdom to manifest it by the uplifted
                                hand.&nbsp; [All hands appeared to be raised.]&nbsp; If there are any
                                who are not willing, they now have the privilege of manifesting it by

                        month after his
                        arrival in Salt Lake Valley, Thomas was married to Hannah Adams (4
                        October 1857), and the couple soon settled in Spainish Fork, where they
                        acquired a small adobe house. Here Brother Marsh attempted, without
                        success, to establish a school. Though having received some financial
                        help from Bishop John L. Butler, the Marshes were scarcely able to
                        sustain life. By late fall of 1859, meager circumstances prompted
                        Thomas to request further assistance. His petition reflected his
                        penitent spirit:</big></font></big></p>

                        ordained a high priest. In the Endowment House on 1 November 1862, he
                        received his endowment and was sealed to his wife, Hannah. It was about
                        this same time that the couple opted to settle near Ogden. Thomas was
                        placed in the care of David M. Stuart, Ogden First Ward. Though almost
                        wholly supported by the Church until his death in January 1866 at
                        Ogden, Thomas Baldwin Marsh "died in good faith," having once again
                        accepted the principles he had espoused nearly thirty-six years earlier
                        in Fayette, New York. He had learned by sad experience the hazards of
                        aspiring to the honors of men, the dangers of exercising unrighteous
                        dominion, and the consequences of uncontrolled criticism of those in

                        ready to return
                        to our homes. We have been counseled by the Brethren and have been
                        strengthened
                        in our faith. As we are about to separate, I should like to emphasize
                        the
                        importance of watching the little things in our lives. Have you ever
                        noticed
                        a large gate in a farm fence? As you open it or close it there appears
                        to be very little movement at the hinge. But there is great movement at
                        the perimeter.</big></font></font>

                <p><big><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+1"><big>Speaking to
                        the Prophet Joseph
                        Smith in 1831, the Lord said: &#8220;Out of small things proceedeth that
                        which
                        is great.&#8221; (D&amp;C 64:33.) It is so with good or evil, my brothers and
                        sisters. Small, kind acts can grow into mammoth good institutions. The
                        Boy Scout movement is an example of this as is known by anyone
                        acquainted
                        with the history of this great institution. It is so likewise with evil
                        things. Small acts of dishonesty, small acts of an immoral nature,
                        small
                        outbursts of anger can grow into great and terrible things.</big></font></font>

                        once on the grounds

                        crude structure in which the Saints met in those days of their poverty.
                        In September of 1857, there was presented in that old bowery on a
                        Sunday
                        afternoon, what was really the concluding act of a drama of great

                        could be a reconciliation between himself and the Church of the living
                        God. He reflected for a moment and said, I am reconciled to the Church,
                        but I want to know whether the Church can be reconciled to me.</big></font></font>

                        sisters,
                        I now introduce to you Brother Thomas B. Marsh. When the Quorum of the
                        Twelve was first organized, he was appointed to be their President.&#8221;</big></font></font>

                        Twelve Apostles and to whom the Lord had spoken in so marvelous a
                        manner,
                        as recorded in section 112 of the Doctrine and Covenants&#8212;which I wish
                        you
                        would read&#8212;said to the people:</big></font></font>

                        know that I can
                        make all this vast congregation hear and understand me. My voice never
                        was very strong, but it has been very much weakened of late years by
                        the
                        afflicting rod of Jehovah. He loved me too much to let me go without
                        whipping.
                        I have seen the hand of the Lord in the chastisement which I have
                        received.
                        I have seen and known that it has [page 82] proved he loved me; for if
                        he had not cared anything about me, he would not have taken me by the
                        arm
                        and given me such a shaking.</big></font></font>

                        backs
                        for a good whipping, if you are such as the Lord loves. But if you will
                        take my advice, you will stand by the authorities; but if you go away
                        and
                        the Lord loves you as much as he did me, he will whip you back again.</big></font></font>

                        the revelations of God as recorded in the Book of Doctrine and

                        should fall away?&#8217; I told them not to feel too secure, but to take heed
                        lest they also should fall; for I had no scruples in my mind as to the
                        possibility of men falling away.&#8221;</big></font></font>

                        did
                        not consider myself a whit behind any of them, and I suppose that
                        others
                        had the same opinion; but, let no one feel too secure; for, before you
                        think of it, your steps will slide. You will not then think nor feel
                        for
                        a moment as you did before you lost the Spirit of Christ; for when men
                        apostatize, they are left to grovel in the dark.&#8221; (<i>Journal of

                        only fifty-seven years of age, he spoke of the travails through which
                        he
                        had passed before he had finally made his way to the valley of the

                        I discovered it, in the Journal of Discourses, in a talk given to the

                        illustrate to all of us the need to be careful in dealing with small

                        a little larger cheese than they otherwise could. To be sure to have
                        justice
                        done, it was agreed that they should not save the strippings (to
                        themselves),

                        strippings,
                        but Mrs. Marsh, wishing to make some extra good cheese, saved a pint of

                        &#8220;an

                        was had.&#8221; President Marsh did not consider that the bishop had done him
                        and his lady justice for they (that is, the bishop&#8217;s court) decided
                        that
                        the strippings were wrongfully saved, and that the woman had violated

                        and,&#8221; says George A. Smith, &#8220;I assure you they were a grave body. Marsh
                        being extremely anxious to maintain the character of his wife, &#8230; made a
                        desperate defence, but the High Council finally confirmed the bishop&#8217;s

                        Saints from their homes and habitations, and some thousands perished
                        through
                        suffering the exposure consequent on this state of affairs.&#8221; (<i>Journal
                            of Discourses</i>, 3:283&#8211;84.) Such is George A. Smith&#8217;s account.</big></font></font>

                        small and trivial
                        thing&#8212;a little cream over which two women quarreled. But it led to, or
                        at least was a factor in, Governor Boggs&#8217; cruel exterminating order
                        which
                        drove the Saints from the state of Missouri, with all of the terrible
                        suffering
                        and consequent death that followed. The man who should have settled
                        this
                        little quarrel, but who, rather, pursued it, troubling the officers of
                        the Church, right up to the Presidency, literally went through hell for
                        it. He lost his standing in the Church. He lost his testimony of the
                        gospel.
                        For nineteen years he walked in poverty and darkness and bitterness,
                        experiencing
                        illness, and loneliness. He grew old before his time. Finally, like the
                        prodigal son in the parable of the Savior (see Luke 15:11&#8211;32), he
                        recognized
                        his foolishness and painfully made his way to this valley, and asked
                        Brigham
                        Young to forgive him and permit his rebaptism into the Church. He had
                        been
                        the first President of the Council of the Twelve, loved, respected, and
                        honored in the days of Kirtland, and the early days of Far West. Now he
                        asked only that he might be ordained a deacon and become a doorkeeper
                        in
                        the house of the Lord.</big></font></font></big>
