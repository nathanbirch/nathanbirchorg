                        align="left" border="0" height="371" width="295">What does it mean to
                    be the seed of Abraham? Scripturally it has a deeper meaning than being
                    his literal descendants. The Lord made a covenant with Abraham, the
                    great patriarch, that all nations would be blessed through him (see
                    Gen. 18:18; Gal. 3:8; 3 Ne. 20:25, 29). Any man or woman can claim the
                    blessings of Abraham. They become his seed and heirs to the promised
                    blessings by accepting the gospel, being baptized, entering into temple
                    marriage, being faithful in keeping their covenants, and helping to
                    carry the gospel to all the nations of the earth.<br>
                    <br>
                    To be empowered to “bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all
                    nations,” (Abr. 2:9) a man must receive the Melchizedek Priesthood with
                    its blessings. Then through faithfulness he becomes an heir to the
                    fulness of eternal life. For as Paul said, “And if ye be Christ’s, then
                    are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise” (Gal. 3:29).<br>
                    <br>
                    As the seed of Abraham, we have some obligations. We are commanded to
                    come to Christ by doing “the works of Abraham” (John 8:39; see also
                    John 8:32–50). These works include obeying God, receiving and keeping
                    priesthood and temple ordinances and covenants, preaching the gospel,
                    building a family unit and teaching our children, and being faithful to
                    the end.<br>
                    <br>
                    It is interesting that the Lord used the word seed in His promise to
                    Abraham. It has a fuller meaning than posterity because it means to
                    multiply the blessings of the covenant of Abraham “unto all nations”
                    (Abr. 2:9). The Lord promised Abraham a posterity “as innumerable as
                    the stars” or “the sand upon the seashore” (D&amp;C 132:30). <br>
                    <br>
                    <i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Abraham’s righteous posterity is also
                        privileged to be adopted into the eternal family of Jesus Christ</i><span
                        style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">.</span> This includes the right to
                    receive eternal covenants in the temple by which, if they are worthy,
                    they will be organized and exalted in the eternal family of Christ (see
                    Gal. 3:29). It also includes “the blessings of salvation, even of life
                    eternal” (Abr. 2:11).&nbsp; [Emphasis added]</font></p>
