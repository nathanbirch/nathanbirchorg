Brother Brigham took the stand, and he took the Bible, and laid it down; he took the Book of Mormon, and laid it down; and he took the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and laid it down before him, and he said: 'There is the written word of God to us, concerning the work of God from the beginning of the world, almost, to our day.'

Thus, a prominent Bible dictionary declares: 'In biblical thought a name is not a mere label of identification; it is an expression of the essential nature of its bearer.  A man's name reveals his character...Hence to know the name of God is to know God as he has revealed himself (Interpreter's Dictionary, 3:500-501).<br><br>For this reason, in biblical thought a change of name signifies a change of nature or essence.  The dictionary observes:  'It could also be said soberly of anyone that his name is his very self.  Thus, when a radical change in a person's character took place so the he became a new man, he was given a new name' (Interpreter's Dictionary, 2:408).   Thus, a king receives a new name on his ascending the throne.<br><br>This understanding helps to explain the new names given to many key figures in the Bible at the time of an important change in their lives.  Examples include Abraham (see Gen. 17:5), Sarah (see Gen. 17:15), Israel (see Gen. 32:28; 35:10) and Peter (see John 1:42).  The idea that a name changes when a person's essence changes also helps to explain the scriptural teaching that a new name is given to all persons who come into the celestial kingdom (see D&C 130:11; see also Isa. 56:5, 62:2; Rev. 2:17, 3:12).<br><br>The most comprehensive biblical illustration of the significance of the word name as signifying the essence of the one named occures in a conversation between the Lord and the prophet Moses.  When the Lord spoke to Moses from the burning bush, He introduced Himself with these words:  'I [am] the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'(Ex. 3:6).  The scripture next reports the Lord's instructions to Moses about his assignment to deliver the children of Israel out of Pharaoh's captivity, and then records this significant exhange:  <br><br><i>And Moses said unto God, Behold, [when] I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What [is] his name? what shall I say unto them?<br>And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. (Ex. 3:13-14)</i><br><br>In English the words I am signify the state of being (the first person present thense of the verb to be).   (In Latin, the verb of being is esse, which is the root source of essence.)  Thus, when Moses asked to know the name of God, he was asking to know the essence or nature of God, and God answered in those same terms.  The Bible dictionary quoted above concludes:  'The uses of the word 'name' in the OT [Old Testament] are all related to the central conception of name as denoting essential being.  This applies with regard to both man and God....The name in the OT is the essence of personality, the expression of innermost being' (Interpreter's Dictionary, 3:501).  ...<br><br>Understanding the word name as a reference to the essence of the one named opens the door to a fuller understanding of numerous scriptures concerning the glorious destination of the children of God.  That goal identifies the ultimate purpose of the gospel plan and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Here we touch upon the ancient doctrine of deification--man becoming a god (see generally, Deification, Early Christian, Encyclopedia of Mormonism [New York: MacMillian, 1992], 1:369-70).  A commonly taught doctrine in the first few centuries of the Christian era, deification was rejected and discredited by later scholars.  Today it is a major point of difference between traditional Christians and Latter-day Saints.<br><br>Among the Bible scriptures relied upon to support the possibility of deification are John's references to Jesus having given mortals power to become 'the sons of God' (John 1:12; 1 John 3:1) and his teaching that 'when he shall appear, we shall be like him' (1 John 3:2).  To the same effect is Peter's teaching that Jesus has 'given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness' by which 'great and precious promises' we 'might be partakers of the divine nature' (2 Peter 1:3-4).<br><br>There are, of course, numerous confirming and even more direct references to deification in modern scriptures.  [Elder Oaks quotes several including 3 Ne. 9:17; Moro. 7:26; D&C 11:30; 35:2; Ether 3:14]  One of the clearest such references is this:  'I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not; but unto as many as received me gave I power to do many miracles, and to become the sons of God; and even unto them that believed on my name gave I power to obtain eternal life' (D&C 45:8).<br><br>Section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants, which has greater detail on this subject than any other published revelation, explains the meaning of 'sons of God' when it describes those who will receive exaltation in the celestial kingdom as those 'who have received of his fulness, and of his glory' (vs  56) and concludes, 'Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God' (vs. 58).  <br><br>Of equal significance to the above references to mortals becoming gods are the numerous teachings in modern scripture that describe the plan of salvation, which is the process by which this occurs.<br><br>Jesus Christ, the Redeemer and Savior of the world, is the essential life-giving source in the plan of salvation.  His saving mission under this plan opens the door and points the way for the children of God to achieve their ultimate destination as sons and daughters of God--to become like Him.  The plan of salvation is not only an expression of the authority and work of our Savior.  It is also the manifestation of His essence  (emphasis added).  <br><br>We began under that plan with a spirit-child relationship to God the Father.  Through His plan and the work of His Only Begotten Son, our spirits were enabled to progess through mortality toward our eternal goal, which is to attain the exalted condition the Apostle Paul described as 'unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ' (Eph. 4:13).  That description refers to a measure of the essence of Christ and His Father.   As stated in modern revelation:  'I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness' (D&C 93:19).<br><br>To 'come unto the Father in [Christ's] name' is to come to the Father through compliance with the laws and ordinances and covenants specified in His plan.  To receive of the fulness of the Father is to receive exaltation or eternal life.<br><br>The word name is threaded through the entire fabric of scriptural descriptions of the glorious plan of salvation, including its process and its intended result.  The name of Jesus Christ was specified from the heavens (see Luke 1:31; Matt. 1:21).  The word name sometimes means the work of salvation, which is the mission of the true Chruch of Jesus Christ.  And the word name sometimes means the essence of Christ or the intended exaltation that is our destination and the result of the plan of salvation.<br><br>What could be more beautiful or more natural for God the Father than to desire and provide a means for His spirit children, who were created in His image, to become like He is?  And what more natural means (more understandable to mortals) to enter upon that path than for His children to born again--spiritually begotten--and to aspire to take upon them the name of their Creator?  Taking that name upon us has obvious family implications, and it also serves to identify our destination as His children.<br><br>Many scriptures invoke the word name in connection with explaining our relationship to God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ and our eternal goal under their plan.  Following are some that explain the plan by means of vivid analogy to birth and to attaining the name (essence) of the Creator.<br><br>In his great valedictory teachings to his people, King Benjamin concluded with these words:<br><br><i>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.<br><br><br>And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.<br><br><br>And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.  (Mosiah 5:7-9)<i><br><br>Similar teachings were given by the Lord to the prophet Alma:<br><br><i>Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine. ...<br><br><br>For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be baptized unto repentance. And whomsoever ye receive shall believe in my name; and him will I freely forgive.<br><br><br>For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him that believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.<br><br><br>For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know me they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand.  (Mosiah 26:18, 22-24)</i><br><br>In these scriptures we learn that those who are qualified by faith and repentance and compliance with the laws and ordinances of the gospel will have their sins borne by the Lord Jesus Christ.  In spiritual and figurative terms they become the sons and daughters of Christ, heirs to His kingdom, with a place at His right hand eternally.  These are they who will be called by His name and receive salvation/exaltation in the last day.<br><br>The resurrected Lord taught this same doctrine when he appeared to the Nephites.<br><br><i>Have they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day;<br><br><br>And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day.  (3 Ne. 27:5-6)</i><br><br>This reference to taking upon us the name of Christ and being 'saved at the last day' is a clear reference to exaltation, which means attaining the essence of Christ.",

Unless we give away those wrong things we cannot 'give place' for the seed of faith to grow (see Alma 32:27). The crowding cares of the world will constrain the things of the Spirit (see Luke 8:14). This need for particularized denial is also strongly emphasized in the directions given by the resurrected Jesus:<br><br><i>Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery; <br>But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart. <br>Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart; <br>For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these things, wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye should  be cast into hell.

Election is an opportunity for service and is both on a national and an individual basis. On a national basis the seed of Abraham carry the gospel to the world. But it is by individual faithfulness that it is done.<br><br>The elect are chosen even “before the foundation of the world,” yet no one is unconditionally elected to eternal life. Each must, for himself, hearken to the gospel and receive its ordinances and covenants from the hands of the servants of the Lord in order to obtain salvation. If one is elected but does not serve, his election could be said to have been in vain, as Paul expressed in 2 Cor. 6: 1.<br><br>We see that elections are not all of the same kind. Since election has to do with God’s choice of persons or groups to accomplish his purposes, some may be elected by him to one thing and some to another. Although the Lord uses certain individuals to accomplish his purposes, it does not necessarily follow that these persons will automatically receive a fulness of salvation thereby. For instance, Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus fulfilled certain purposes in the economy of God, but they apparently did it for their own reasons and not as conscious acts of faith and righteousness. On the other hand, salvation of one’s soul comes only by personal integrity and willing obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thus there are some elections to be desired over others. An “election of grace” spoken of in D&C 84: 98-102 and Rom. 11: 1-5 has reference to one’s situation in mortality; that is, being born at a time, at a place, and in circumstances where one will come in favorable contact with the gospel. This election took place in the premortal existence. Those who are faithful and diligent in the gospel in mortality receive an even more desirable election in this life, and become the elect of God. These receive the promise of a fulness of God’s glory in eternity (D&C 84: 33-41).<br><br>The concept held by many that God unconditionally elected some to be saved and some to be damned without any effort, action, or choice on their part is not correct, for the scriptures teach that it is only by faith and obedience that one’s calling and election is made sure (2 Pet. 1; D&C 131: 5).",

Many of the valiant and noble spirits in that first estate were chosen, elected, and foreordained to be born into the family of Jacob, so as to be natural heirs of all of the blessings of the gospel. (Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, 2:284)<br><br>As part of the new song the saints will sing when they 'see eye to eye' and the millennial era has been ushered in will be these words, 'The Lord hath redeemed his people, Israel, According to the election of grace, Which was brought to pass by the faith And covenant of their fathers.' (D. & C. 84:98-102; Rom. 11:1-5.) This election of grace is a very fundamental, logical, and important part of God's dealings with men through the ages. To bring to pass the salvation of the greatest possible number of his spirit children the Lord, in general, sends the most righteous and worthy spirits to earth through the lineage of Abraham and Jacob. This course is a manifestation of his grace or in other words his love, mercy, and condescension toward his children.<br><br>This election to a chosen lineage is based on pre-existent worthiness and is thus made 'according to the foreknowledge of God.' (1 Pet. 1:2.) Those so grouped together during their mortal probation have more abundant opportunities to make and keep the covenants of salvation, a right which they earned by pre-existent devotion to the cause of righteousness. As part of this election, Abraham and others of the noble and great spirits were chosen before they were born for the particular missions assigned them in this life. (Abra. 3:22-24; Rom. 9.) <br><br>As with every basic doctrine of the gospel, the Lord's system of election based on pre-existent faithfulness has been changed and perverted by an apostate Christendom. So absurd have been the false conclusions reached in this field that millions of sincere though deceived persons have devoutly believed that in accordance with the divine will men were pre-destined to receive salvation or damnation which no act on their part could change. (Teachings, p. 189.) <br><br>Actually, if the full blessings of salvation are to follow, the doctrine of election must operate twice. First, righteous spirits are elected or chosen to come to mortality as heirs of special blessings. Then, they must be called and elected again in this life, an occurrence which takes place when they join the true Church. (D. & C. 53:1.) Finally, in order to reap eternal salvation, they must press forward in obedient devotion to the truth until they make their 'calling and election sure' (2 Pet. 1), that is, are 'sealed up unto eternal life.' (D. & C. 131:5.) ",

The events that transpired there are significant: (a) The Lord proclaimed Far West a holy and consecrated land unto him, declaring to Joseph Smith that the very ground he stood on there was holy. (b) The Prophet Joseph Smith contended with the devil face to face for some time, upon the occasion of the power of evil menacing one of his children in the Prophet's home just west of the temple site. Lucifer declared that Joseph had no right to be there, that this was his place. Whereupon the Prophet rebuked Satan in the name of the Lord, and he departed and did not touch the child again. (c) The overwhelming feeling that President McKay had when he visited this sacred place.    <br><br>'The Answer: I have often pondered the holy significance of Far West, and even more so since President McKay's visit. The sacredness of Far West, Missouri, is no doubt due to the understanding that the Prophet Joseph Smith conveyed to the brethren, at these early times, that Adam-ondi-Ahman, the place to which Adam and Eve fled when cast out of the Garden of Eden, is where Adam erected an altar unto God, and offered sacrifices, and that Far West was the spot where Cain killed Abel.    <br><br>'This information tends to explain why the Lord declared Far West to be a holy consecrated place; and no doubt explains why Satan claimed that place as his own, as it was here that he entered into a covenant with Cain, resulting in the death of Abel, the first of mortal existence [to die] upon this earth.    <br><br>'It would appear that President McKay while there felt the spirit and significance of this holy place.'

But whether man calls it convention or business, or uses any other euphemism, if it offends God's law it is sin.<br><br>Some would categorize as minor the sins discussed in this chapter, but when not repented of they will still keep us from eternal life. Perhaps most of us have our share of them. Here they are treated only briefly and with no thought that the list is exhaustive.<br><br>Idolatry<br><br>From Mount Sinai came God's unalterable command:<br><br>Thou shalt have no other Gods before me.<br><br>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:<br><br>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them (Ex. 20:3-5. Italics added.)<br><br>This proscription embraces not only images in the form of God or of man, but the likeness of anything which is earthly in any form. It would include both tangible and less tangible things, and everything which entices a person away from duty, loyalty, and love for and service to God.<br><br>Idolatry is among the most serious of sins. There are unfortunately millions today who prostrate themselves before images of gold and silver and wood and stone and clay. But the idolatry we are most concerned with here is the conscious worshiping of still other gods. Some are of metal and plush and chrome, of wood and stone and fabrics. They are not in the image of God or of man, but are developed to give man comfort and enjoyment, to satisfy his wants, ambitions, passions and desires. Some are in no physical form at all, but are intangible.<br><br>Many seem to 'worship' on an elemental basis they live to eat and drink. They are like the children of Israel who, though offered the great freedoms associated with national development under God's personal guidance, could not lift their minds above the 'flesh pots of Egypt.' They cannot seem to rise above satisfying their bodily appetites. As Paul put it, their 'God is their belly.'

Degrees and letters and titles can become idols. Many young men decide to attend college when they should be on missions first. The degree, and the wealth and the security which come through it, appear so desirable that the mission takes second place. Some neglect Church service through their college years, feeling to give preference to the secular training and ignoring the spiritual covenants they have made.<br><br>Many people build and furnish a home and buy the automobile first—and then find they 'cannot afford' to pay tithing. Whom do they worship? Certainly not the Lord of heaven and earth, for we serve whom we love and give first consideration to the object of our affection and desires. Young married couples who postpone parenthood until their degrees are attained might be shocked if their expressed preference were labeled idolatry. Their rationalization gives them degrees at the expense of children. Is it a justifiable exchange? Whom do they love and worship—themselves or God? Other couples, recognizing that life is not intended primarily for comforts, ease, and luxuries, complete their educations while they move forward with full lives, having their children and giving Church and community service.<br><br>Many worship the hunt, the fishing trip, the vacation, the weekend picnics and outings. Others have as their idols the games of sport, baseball, football, the bullfight, or golf. These pursuits more often than not interfere with the worship of the Lord and with giving service to the building up of the kingdom of God. To the participants this emphasis may not seem serious, yet it indicates where their allegiance and loyalty are.<br><br>Still another image men worship is that of power and prestige. Many will trample underfoot the spiritual and often the ethical values in their climb to success. These gods of power, wealth, and influence are most demanding and are quite as real as the golden calves of the children of Israel in the wilderness.  (Spencer W.

Oliver Cowdery went with the Prophet Joseph when he deposited these plates. Joseph did not translate all of the plates; there was a portion of them sealed, which you can learn from the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. When Joseph got the plates, the angel instructed him to carry them back to the hill Cumorah, which he did. Oliver says that when Joseph and Oliver went there, the hill opened, and they walked into a cave, in which there was a large and spacious room. He says he did not think, at the time, whether they had the light of the sun or artificial light; but that it was just as light as day. They laid the plates on a table; it was a large table that stood in the room. Under this table there was a pile of plates as much as two feet high, and there were altogether in this room more plates than probably many wagon loads; they were piled up in the corners and along the walls. The first time they went there the sword of Laban hung upon the wall; but when they went again it had been taken down and laid upon the table across the gold plates; it was unsheathed, and on it was written these words: 'This sword will never be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our God and his Christ.'

The children of Israel, even in their greatest number, never fulfilled the promise of the Lord concerning their magnitude when dwelling in the land of Palestine. The prediction was that their number should be as countless as the stars or the sand upon the seashore. In Palestine they never reached proportions too great to be numbered nor have they reached this number in their scattered condition although they had become absorbed into the body of the Gentile nations. Moreover, they, through this scattering, planted in the hearts of the Gentiles to some degree a desire to worship the God of Abraham and to accept of his teachings and the teachings of the prophets who came through his seed. Because the Jews rejected Jesus Christ they were scattered as the Savior predicted; but the Lord has kept them, for his own purpose, as a distinct people. They have not mixed to any great extent with the Gentiles by marriage, but have maintained their racial identity. And when Christ comes, he will appear to the gathered Jews as predicted by Zechariah.",

Any person, therefore, who has accepted the restored gospel, and who now seeks to worship the Lord in his own tongue and with the Saints in the nations where he lives, has complied with the law of the gathering of Israel and is heir to all of the blessings promised the Saints in these last days. <br><br>The Saints are no longer to come to a single place. In 1955, Sister Kimball and I went to Europe. We spent six months touring all of the missions in Europe. The people were still laboring under the impression that they should come to America for the gathering process. The burden of our sermons to them was, 'Stay where you are. You have received the gospel. The blessings will be brought to you. It will not be long until you have stakes, and the Brethren will come across the ocean to visit you. Eventually temples will come, and you will have all the blessings of Zion.' <br><br>Now you folks of South America are in a different category: you have always lived in Zion. One of the Brethren said that Zion was all of America and that it is like a great bird with two wide wings: North America and South America. <br><br>Many people have been holding their breath waiting to see the gathering of Israel. We are in Israel and are being gathered. <br><br>Now, in the early days of the Church we used to preach for the people to come to Utah as the gathering process, largely because that was the only place in the whole world where there was a temple. Now we have sixteen temples, and two more that have been approved, scattered throughout the world. So it is no longer necessary that we bring the people all to Salt Lake City. Our missionaries preach baptism and confirmation. And then we come to you with conferences and to organize stakes. So we say again, stay in Korea. This is a beautiful land. In this land you can teach your children just as well as you could in Salt Lake City. Stay in Korea where you can teach the gospel to millions of people. <br><br>And so the gathering is taking place. Korea is the gathering place for Koreans, Australia for Australians, Brazil for Brazilians, England for the English. And so we move forward toward the confirmation of this great program the Lord has established for us. <br><br>The First Presidency and the Twelve see great wisdom in the multiple Zions, many gathering places where the Saints within their own culture and nation can act as a leaven in the building of the kingdom -- a kingdom which seeks no earthly rewards or treasures. <br><br>Sometimes, inadvertently, we have given artificial encouragement to individuals to leave their native land and culture and, too often, this has meant the loss of the leaven that is so badly needed, and the individuals involved have sometimes regretted their migrations. <br><br>I am hopeful that each of you will ponder carefully what it is the Lord would have you do with your lives, with the special skills, training, and testimonies you have.",

Again there is a distinction between Israel as a whole and the Ten Tribes who are the dominant portion of Jacob's seed. All scripture comes by the power of the Holy Ghost and is verily true. When special and unusual language is used, there is a reason. Holy writ is not idle chatter; it is the mind and will of the Lord; it says what he wants said. And so it now behooves us to learn why it is one thing to gather Israel from the four parts of the earth and yet another to lead the Ten Tribes from the land of the north. <br><br>We have already seen that all Israel, including specifically and pointedly the Ten Tribes, is scattered in all the nations of the earth, upon all the islands of the sea, and among every people who dwell on this planet. It is absolutely basic and fundamental to know this. We cannot understand the gathering of Israel, we cannot envision what is meant by the restoration of the Ten Tribes, and we cannot properly relate these two things to the Second Coming of our Lord unless we know where Israel and the Ten Tribes now are. <br><br> We are also aware that the Ten Tribes were first taken as a body into Assyria; that they went out from Assyria, northward, in a body, under prophetic guidance; and that they were then splintered and driven and scattered into all places and among all peoples. These Ten Tribes, no matter where they are located, are in nations and places known in the days of Isaiah and Jeremiah and the ancient prophets as the north countries. Hence, their return to Palestine at least will be from the land of the north. <br><br>The tribe of Ephraim is one of the Ten Tribes; and her people became wanderers in the nations, where they now reside and where they are now being found and gathered, one of a city and two of a family, into the stakes of Zion in those nations. This gathering of Israel is not to an American Zion; it is not to Palestine and the ancient holy land; it is not to any central place or location. Rather, it is to the holy places of safety that are now being set up in all nations as rapidly as our strength and means permit. As we have seen, this gathering of Ephraim falls in the category of the gathering of Israel and not of the leading of the Ten Tribes from the land of the north. This gathering of Ephraim is into the stakes of Zion in all the nations of the earth. There are, of course, isolated and unusual instances of people from the other lost tribes gathering with Ephraim, but these are few and far between. The gathering of these other tribes is not yet, but by and by. <br><br>What, then, is meant by the leading of the Ten Tribes from the land of the north? Our answer is: Just what the words say. We are gathering Israel now in all nations and counseling them to stay where they are, there to enlarge the borders of Zion, there to build up stakes of Zion in their own lands and among their own people. But with the Ten Tribes, in part at least, it will be another thing. They are destined to return (at least in large and representative numbers) to the same soil where the feet of their forebears walked during the days of their mortal pilgrimage. They are to return to Palestine. At least a constituent assembly will congregate there in the very land given of God to Abraham their father. Others will, of course, be in America and in all lands, but the formal return, the return from the north countries, will be to the land of their ancient inheritance. . . . <br><br>It is clear; it is plain; it is certain: God gave ancient Canaan to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the twelve tribes of Israel, of whom the Ten Tribes are the dominant part. It is their land, in time and in eternity. It is their land now whenever they are worthy to tread its blessed surface. And it shall be theirs again in that everlasting eternity that lies ahead. 'It is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it,' in that celestial day when it shall be crowned with the presence of God, even the Father. (D&C 88:17-19.) Where else, then, would we expect to see the Ten Tribes return? Where else would we expect them to assemble to worship the God of their fathers and to be inheritors of the promises made to the ancient ones whose seed they are? <br><br>Thus it is that we see why the revelations speak of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth into the Church and kingdom of God on earth, and also of the leading of the Ten Tribes from the land of the north back again to their promised Canaan. The gathering of Israel is one thing, the return of the Ten Tribes to a specified place is another; and Moses gave to men in our day the keys and power to perform both labors. This means that Israel is gathered at the direction and pursuant to the power and authority vested in the legal administrators who preside over The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And it also means that the Ten Tribes -- scattered, lost, unknown, and now in all the nations of the earth -- these Ten Tribes, with their prophets, with their scriptures, in faith and desiring righteousness, shall return to blessed Canaan at the direction of these same legal administrators. The President of the Church is the only person on earth at any given time who does or can exercise these or any other priesthood keys in their eternal fulness. He will direct the return of the Ten Tribes. It will not come to pass in any other way. . . . <br><br>We do not say that occasional blood descendants of Reuben or Naphtali or others of the other tribal heads shall not return to their Palestinian Zion, or assemble in an American Zion, or find their way into the stakes of Zion in all nations, all before the Second Coming of Christ. Some shall no doubt return to Canaan as true believers and members of the true Church, with the intent and purpose of fulfilling the scriptures and building up the ancient cities of Israel. This may well happen in some small measure, and to it there can be no objection. Great movements have small beginnings, and floods that sweep forth from bursting dams are first forecast when small rivulets trickle from the pent-up reservoirs. But we do say that the great day of the return of the Ten Tribes, the day when the assembling hosts shall fulfill the prophetic promises, shall come after our Lord's return. . . . <br><br>In that day, 'They who are in the north countries shall come in remembrance before the Lord.' The lost tribes of Israel, the Ten Tribes whose members are scattered among the northern nations, shall be remembered. The set time to favor them will have dawned. The work of the Father will then commence among them; converts will be made; they will believe the everlasting gospel tan to them by the elders of Ephraim; and they will be baptized and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. They will become again the Lord's people. 'And their prophets shall hear his voice, and shall no longer stay themselves.' <br><br>Their prophets! Who are they? Are they to be holy men called from some unknown place and people? Are they prophets unbeknown to the presiding officers of 'the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth'? (D&C 1:30.) Perish the thought! The President of the Church, who holds the keys to lead the Ten Tribes from the nations of the north wherein they now reside, holds also the keys of salvation for all men. There are not two true churches on earth, only one; there are not two gospels or two be plans of salvation, only one; there are not two competing organizations, both having divine approval, only one. 'Is Christ divided?' (1 Cor. 1:13.) God forbid. Their prophets are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They are stake presidents and bishops and quorum presidents who are appointed to guide and direct the destinies of their stakes and wards and quorums.",

       {what:      "Recollect that we are now calling upon the Elders to go and gather up Israel; this is the mission that is given to us. It was the first mission given to the Elders in the days of Joseph. The set time is come for God to gather Israel, and for His work to commence upon the face of the whole earth, and the Elders who have arisen in this Church and Kingdom are actually of Israel. Take the Elders who are now in this house, and you can scarcely find one out of a hundred but what is of the house of Israel. It has been remarked that the Gentiles have been cut off, and I doubt whether another Gentile ever comes into this Church. <br>Will we go to the Gentile nations to preach the Gospel? Yes, and gather out the Israelites, wherever they are mixed among the nations of the earth. What part or portion of them? The same part or portion that redeemed the house of Jacob, and saved them from perishing with famine in Egypt. When Jacob blessed the two sons of Joseph, 'guiding his hands wittingly,' he placed his right hand upon Ephraim, 'and he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,' etc. Joseph was about to remove the old man's hands, and bringing his right hand upon the head of the oldest boy, saying--'Not so, my father; for this is the first born; put thy right hand upon his head. And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.' Ephraim has become mixed with all the nations of the earth, and it is Ephraim that is gathering together. <br>It is Ephraim that I have been searching for all the days of my preaching, and that is the blood which ran in my veins when I embraced the Gospel. If there are any of the other tribes of Israel mixed with the Gentiles we are also searching for them. Though the Gentiles are cut off, do not suppose that we are not going to preach the Gospel among the Gentile nations, for they are mingled with the house of Israel, and when we send to the nations we do not seek for the Gentiles, because they are disobedient and rebellious. We want the blood of Jacob, and that of his father Isaac and Abraham, which runs in the veins of the people. There is a particle of it here, and another there, blessing the nations as predicted. <br>Take a family of ten children, for instance, and you may find nine of them purely of the Gentile stock, and one son or one daughter in that family who is purely of the Blood of Ephraim. It was in the veins of the father or mother, and was reproduced in the son or daughter, while all the rest of the family are Gentiles. You may think that is singular, but it is true. It is the house of Israel we are after, and we care not whether they come from the east, the west, the north, or the south; from China, Russia, England, California, North or South America, or some other locality; and it is the very lad on whom father Jacob laid his hands, that will save the house of Israel. The Book of Mormon came to Ephraim, for Joseph Smith was a pure Ephraimite, and the Book of Mormon was revealed to him, and while he lived he made it his business to search for those who believed the Gospel. <br>Again, if a pure Gentile firmly believes the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and yields obedience to it, in such a case I will give you the words of the Prophet Joseph-- 'When the Lord pours out the Holy Ghost upon that individual he will have spasms, and you would think that he was going into fits.' <br>Joseph said that the Gentile blood was actually cleansed out of their veins, and the blood of Jacob made to circulate in them; and the revolution and change in the system were so great that it caused the beholder to think they were going into fits. <br>If any of the Gentiles will believe, we will lay our hands upon them that they may receive the Holy Ghost, and the Lord will make them of the house of Israel. They will be broken off from the wild olive tree, and be grafted into the good and tame olive tree, and will partake of its sap and fatness. If you take a bud and inoculate it into another tree it ceases to receive nourishment from its original stock; it must, however, receive nourishment, or it will die. Where must it receive its nourishment from? From the tree into which it has been introduced; it is supported by it, and becomes incorporated with it. <br>It is so with the House of Israel and the Gentile nations; if the Gentiles are grafted into the good olive tree they will partake of its root and fatness. <br>You understand who we are; we are of the House of Israel, of the royal seed, of the royal blood.",

There is a maze of fuzzy thinking and shoddy scholarship, both in the world and in the Church, that seeks to identify the Jews, both ancient and modern, and to expound upon what they have believed and do believe. It is not strange that the divines of the day-not knowing that the kingdom is to be restored to Israel at that glorious day; not having the Book of Mormon and latter-day revelation to guide them-it is not strange that they come up with false and twisted views about the mission and destiny of the Jews. It is a little sad that church members sometimes partake of these false views and of this secular spirit so as to misread the signs of the times. <br><br>The term Jew is a contraction of the name Judah, but the Jews are not the members of the tribe of Judah as such. After the reign of Solomon, the Lord's people divided into the kingdom of Israel  and the kingdom of Judah. Nearly ten tribes served Jeroboam in Israel and two and a half tribes served Rehoboam in Judah. The Levites were scattered among all the tribes. Judah, Simeon, and part of Benjamin comprised the kingdom of Judah. In actual fact, and considering blood lineage only, both kingdoms had in them people from all of the tribes. Lehi, who lived in Judah and was a Jew, was of the tribe of Manasseh. The Jews were nationals of the kingdom of Judah without reference to tribal ancestry. Thus the descendants of Lehi, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, were Jews because they came out from Jerusalem and from the kingdom of Judah. (2 Ne. 33:8.)    <br><br>The Jews today are also those whose origins stem back to the kingdom of their fathers. Clearly the dominant tribe-dominant, however, only in the sense of political power and rulership-was Judah. As to the bloodlines, who knows whether there are more of Judah or of Simeon or of Benjamin or of some other tribe among the Jews as we know them? Paul, a Jew, was of the tribe of Benjamin. The name Judea, now used as a noun, is actually an adjective meaning Jewish and is the Greek and Roman designation for the land of Judah.    <br><br>Since the Ten Tribes were taken into Assyria and lost from the knowledge of their fellows more than a century before the Jews went into Babylonian captivity, the prophets began to speak of Jews and Gentiles and to consider as a Gentile everyone who was not a Jew. This classifies Ephraim and the rest of scattered Israel as Gentiles. Everyone, in this sense, who is not a Jew is a Gentile, a concept that will enable us, in due course, to set forth what is meant by the fulness of the Gentiles. ",

What is not so well known is that nearly all the passages of scripture, both ancient and modern, which speak of God as our Father and of men on earth being the sons of God, have no reference to our birth in preexistence as the children of Elohim, but teach rather that Jehovah is our Father and we are his children.   <br><br>In setting forth that all men must be born again to gain salvation, we have seen that this means they must be \"born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters.\" (Mosiah 27:25.) Whose sons and whose daughters do we become when we are born again? Who is our new Father? The answer is, Christ is our Father; we become his children by adoption; he makes us members of his family.... <br><br>But there is more than this to the doctrine of becoming sons of God. Those who so obtain are adopted also into the family of Elohim. They become his adopted sons so that they can receive, inherit, and possess along with his natural Son. <br><br>To envision what is meant by being sons of God, meaning the Father, let us follow Paul's reasoning in two passages of superlative insight and inspiration. To the Romans our apostolic friend of old wrote: \"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\" Standing alone, this could be taken to mean that by faith the saints become the sons of the Lord Jesus. But the perspective begins to change when our apostolic colleague says: \"Ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\" That is, we call upon our Eternal Father in a familiar and friendly way, as children here call to their fathers with whom they maintain a familiar intimacy. Having attained this state of friendship with the Eternal One, \"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit,\" Paul continues, \"that we are the children of God.\" He has now laid the groundwork. A pronouncement of deep and wondrous import is immediately forthcoming. \"And if children\"–note it well–\"then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.\" (Rom. 8:14-17.) ... <br><br>The reasoning is perfect. The Father had a Son, a natural Son, his own literal Seed, the Offspring of his body. This Son is his heir. As an heir he inherits all things from his Father–all power, all might, all dominion, the world, the universe, kingship, eternal exaltation, all things. But our revelations speak of men being exalted also and of their ascending the throne of eternal power. How is it done? Paul has explained it perfectly. They are adopted into the family of the Father. They become joint-heirs with his natural Son ... <br><br>They constitute the sole and only way the eternal increase of an Eternal Father can become like their great Progenitor. As pertaining to this earth, they were revealed first to father Adam. He was baptized, born again, received the priesthood, and kept the commandments. As a result thereof, \"a voice out of heaven\" proclaimed: \"Thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus may all become my sons.\" (Moses 6:65-68.) \"Our father Adam taught these things,\" the scripture says, \"and many have believed and become the sons of God, and many have believed not, and have perished in their sins.\" (Moses 7:1)",

(D&C 134:33-41.) In his famous King Follett Sermon, speaking of those who “shall be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ,” the Prophet asked what their glory should be. Answering his own query, he described joint-heirship as inheriting “the same power, the same glory and the same exaltation, until you arrive at the station of a God, and ascend the throne of eternal power, the same as those who have gone before.” (Teachings, p. 347.)<br><br>A joint-heir is one who inherits equally with all other heirs including the Chief Heir who is the Son. Each joint-heir has an equal and an undivided portion of the whole of everything. If one knows all things, so do all others. If one has all power, so do all those who inherit jointly with him. If the universe belongs to one, so it does equally to the total of all upon whom the joint inheritances are bestowed.<br><br>Joint-heirs are possessors of all things. (D&C 50:26-28.)

We have felt, as President Taylor said, that we have got to have more  revelation  concerning sealing under the law of adoption.  Well, what are these changes?  One of them is the principle of adoption.  In the commencement of adopting men and women in the Temple at Nauvoo, a great many persons were adopted to different men who were not of the lineage of their fathers, and there was a spirit manifested by some in that work that was not of God. ..President Young was not satisfied in his mind with regard to the extent of this matter;  President Taylor was not.  <br><br>When I went before the Lord to know who I should be adopted to (we were then being adopted to prophets and apostles), the Spirit of God said to me, “Have you not a father, who begot you?”  “Yes, I have.”  “Then why not honor him?  Why not be adopted to him?”  “Yes,” says I, “that is right.”  I was adopted to my father, and should have had my father sealed to his father, and so on back; and the duty that I want every man who presides over a temple to see performed from this day henceforth and forever, unless the Lord Almighty commands otherwise, is, let every man be adopted to his father.  When a man receives the endowments, adopt him to his father; not to Wilford Woodruff, nor to any other man outside the lineage of his fathers.  That is the will of God to this people.  I want all men who preside over these temples in these mountains of Israel to bear this in mind. What business have I to take away the rights of the lineage of any man? What right has any man to do this?. No; I say let every man be adopted to his father; and then you will do exactly what God said when he declared he would send Elijah the prophet in the last days. Elijah the prophet appeared unto Joseph Smith and told him that the day had come when this principle must be carried out. Joseph Smith did not live long enough to enter any further upon these things. His soul was wound up with this work before he was martyred for the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ. He told us that there must be a welding link of all dispensations and of the work of God from one generation to another. This was upon his mind more than most any other subject that was given to him.",

Those who are enlightened by the spirit of truth, have no difficulty in seeing the propriety and the benefit to us of this state of things. Like heavenly beings, we are endowed with the power of free volition; for God has given to mankind their agency, making them amenable to him for their sins, and entitling them to blessings and rewards for the good they do, and according to their faith in him. It is the wish of our Heavenly Father to bring all his children back into his presence. The spirits of all the human family dwelt with him before they took tabernacles of flesh and became subject to the fall and to sin. He is their spiritual Father, and has sent them here to be clothed with flesh, and to be subject, with their tabernacles, to the ills that afflict fallen humanity. When they have proved themselves faithful in all things, and worthy before Him, they can then have the privilege of returning again to his presence, with their bodies, to dwell in the abodes of the blessed.

No. Would he know anything about red, blue, violet, or yellow? No; you could not describe it to him by any way you might undertake.

Let the man to whom all the beauties of light have been displayed, and who has never been in darkness, be in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, deprived of his natural sight; what a change this would be to him; he never knew anything about darkness before, he never understood the principle at all; it never entered the catalogue of his ideas, until darkness came upon him, and his eye-sight was destroyed: now he can comprehend that the medium he once existed in was light.

It is in us and in all things; it is around us and around all things; it fills the earth and the heavens and the universe. It is everywhere, in all immensity, without exception; it is an indwelling, immanent, ever-present, never-absent spirit. It has neither shape nor form nor personality. It is not an entity nor a person nor a personage. It has no agency, does not act independently, and exists not to act but to be acted upon. As far as we know, it has no substance and is not material, at least as we measure these things. It is variously described as light and life and law and truth and power. It is the light of Christ; it is the life that is in all things; it is the law by which all things are governed; it is truth shining forth in darkness; it is the power of God who sitteth upon his throne. It may be that it is also priesthood and faith and omnipotence, for these too are the power of God.<br><br>This light of truth or light of Christ is seen in the light of the luminaries of heaven; it is the power by which the sun, moon, and stars, and the earth itself are made. It is the light that proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space.\" It is \"the light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things.\" It is the agency of God’s power; it is the means and way whereby \"he comprehendeth all things,\" so that \"all things are before him, and all<br><br>things are round about him.\" It is the way whereby \"he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things.\" Because of it, \"all things are by him, and of him, even God, forever and ever.\" (D&C 88:6-13, 41.)<br><br>Thus, when the Mosaic account of the creation says that \"the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters\" (Genesis 1:2), and when Abraham records of those same events that \"the Spirit of the Gods was brooding upon the face of the waters\" (Abraham 4:2), the revealed word is speaking of the light of Christ. And when Job says that \"by his spirit [the Lord] hath garnished the heavens\" (Job 26:13), and the Psalmist explains that all things were created because the Lord sent forth his spirit, by which also he \"renewest the face of the earth\" (Psalm 104:30), both are teaching the same truth. Creation itself came by the light of Christ.<br><br>The light of Christ is neither the Holy Ghost nor the gift of the Holy Ghost; but that member of the Godhead, because he along with the Father and the Son is God, uses the light of Christ for his purposes. Thus spiritual gifts, the gifts of God meaning faith, miracles, prophecy, and all the rest -- come from God by the power of the Holy Ghost. Men prophesy, for instance, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost. And yet Moroni says: \"All these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ\" (Moroni 10:17), meaning that the Holy Ghost uses the light of Christ to transmit his gifts. But the Spirit of Christ, by which the Holy Ghost operates, is no more the Holy Ghost himself than the light and heat of the sun are the sun itself.",

Well, that is a terrible majority against us:  but let us look at this a little.  I do not think that we need be very badly scared.  You recollect at one time a young man was with Elisha the Prophet, when a large host compassed the city, both with horses and chariots, and a battle was imminent.  It was turbulent times with Israel then, worse than it is with us now.  The defending army was a very small one, and the heart of the young man began to falter.  He could not see how the few of Israel were going to prevail against their numerous enemies.  Whereupon Elisha prayed, and said, \"Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he\" the young man \"may see.\"  And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw:  and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.  Fear not, said the Prophet, \"for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.\"<br><br>Now, it is so with us exactly.  All the fathers who have gone before, the Prophet Joseph, and Hyrum, the Apostles and Patriarchs, the Elders, High Priests, and hosts of others, say nothing of the fathers of our generation hundreds of years back, are all around us, waiting and watching and anxious to see us go forward and triumph; so that we have really more for us than against us, the fifty-five millions to the contrary notwithstanding.  Therefore, we have no occasion to let our hands hang down from fear, or our knees to tremble; not a bit of it.",

The theme discoursed upon is the presence in heaven of two kinds or classes of beings, namely first, resurrected beings and, second, spirits who are not resurrected. It is not asserted that there are no other kinds of persons in heaven than they, but the subject treated is of the two classes mentioned.<br><br>    There are angels of various appointments and stations. Michael is called an “archangel” (Doc. & Cov. 29:26; Dan. 10:13). Some are resurrected beings like the angel that was sent to John the Revelator (Rev. 23:8, 9) and those already referred to in Doc. & Cov. sec. 132, while others are “ministering spirits sent forth to minister unto them who shall be heirs of salvation” (Heb. 1:14). Some of these angels are described as “the spirits of just men made perfect” and are “not resurrected,” and others were made ministering spirits before entering into mortality, serving among their fellows in their pre-existent state. Christ was a ministering spirit before his birth into this world. He was “anointed above his fellows.” The angel Gabriel was a ministering spirit after he had been a mortal man (Noah), and before his resurrection, for Jesus of Nazareth was, as quoted by “Subscriber,” “the first-fruits of them that slept.” (See Luke 1:11-30; Dan. 8:16; 9:21.)<br><br>Angels are God’s messengers, whether used in that capacity as unembodied spirits, selected according to their capacities for the work required, or as disembodied spirits, or as translated men, or as resurrected beings. They are agents of Deity of different degrees of intelligence, power and authority, under the direction of higher dignitaries, and subject to law and order in their respective spheres. ...

As part of the doctrine of opposition, Satan is also at work in the world, and we knew before we came here that he would bring grief and anguish with him. Nevertheless, we (through Adam and Eve) made the conscious choice to live in and endure this mortal sphere of opposition in all things, for only through such an experience was godly progress possible. Adam and Eve-and we-knowingly and lovingly absolved God of the responsibility for the \"thorns and thistles\" of a fallen world that was personally chosen by us, not capriciously imposed by him. We wanted the chance to become like our heavenly parents, to face suffering and overcome it, to endure sorrow and still live rejoicingly, to confront good and evil and be strong enough to choose the good. In this telestial, mortal world filled with competing voices, enticements, and experiences, we get a lifetime of opportunity to refine and strengthen these virtues.<br><br>Understanding this doctrine, Lehi noted that for Adam and Eve to have remained in the garden of Eden would have kept all things \"in the same state in which they were after they were created,\" a situation in which they would have \"remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.\" <br><br>But Adam and Eve made their choice for an even more generous reason than those of godly knowledge and personal progress. They did it for the one overriding and commanding reason basic to the entire plan of salvation and all the discussions ever held in all the councils of heaven. They did it \"that men might be.\" Had Adam and Eve never left the garden, Lehi noted, \"they would have had no children\" [2 Ne. 2:25].",

       {what:      "NATURAL MAN<br>Many things happened in the process of the Fall, including changes that came to the physical bodies of Adam and Eve. For one thing, they fell into \"nature,\" the word becoming something of a synonym for the Adamic process. King Benjamin would say of little children, \"As in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.\" [Mosiah 3:16; emphasis added]<br><br>Part of the natural world Adam and Eve entered included the addition to their bodies of blood-a corruptible ingredient-in what had been to that point an uncorrupted body of bloodless flesh and bone. But even more important than such physical changes were the temptations of and threats to the spirit. Spiritual as well as physical separation from God came with the Fall. Humankind was cut off from the immediate personal companionship with God that Adam and Eve had enjoyed in the garden of Eden. As a result, they were distanced from the Holy Spirit and became less responsive to many of the things of righteousness. King Benjamin made that issue one of the central tasks for men and women to deal with in their fallen, or natural, state. <br><br>\"The natural man is an enemy to God,\" he taught, \"and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.\" [Mosiah 3:19] <br> <br><br>More extreme language than that of \"natural man\" or even \"enemy to God\" is Abinadi's pronouncement that as a result of the Fall and the increased influence of Satan in the fallen world, \"all mankind [became] carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil. <br><br>\"Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state. <br> <br><br>\"But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.\" [Mosiah 16:3-5]<br><br>The brother of Jared made reference to that mortal alienation between man and God when he plaintively cried to the Lord, \"O Lord, . . . do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually.\" [Ether 3:2]<br><br>Because this doctrine is so basic to the plan of salvation and also because it is so susceptible to misunderstanding, we must note that these references to \"natural\" evil emphatically do not mean that men and women are \"inherently\" evil. There is a crucial difference. As spiritual sons and daughters of God, all mortal men and women are divine in origin and divine in their potential destiny. As Doctrine and Covenants 93:38-39 teaches, the spirit of every man, woman, and child \"was innocent in the beginning.\" But it is also true that as a result of the Fall they are now in a \"natural\" (fallen) world where the devil \"taketh away light\" and where some elements of nature-including temporal human nature-need discipline, restraint, and refinement. It is as if men and women are given, as part of their next step in development along the path to godhood, raw physical and spiritual ingredients-\"natural\" resources, if you will. Those resources are not to run rampant but are to be harnessed and focused so that their power and potential (as is sometimes done with a \"natural\" river or a \"natural\" waterfall) can be channeled and thereby made even more productive and beneficial. <br><br>Natural man, with all of his new and wonderful but as yet unbridled and unregenerated potential, must be made \"submissive\" to the Holy Spirit, a spirit that still entices and lifts us upward. The brother of Jared acknowledged the inherent goodness of the soul when he said that our mortal transgressions and temporal natures can be overcome when we call upon God and from him \"receive according to our desires.\" Our deepest desires, our premortal yearnings, are still divine in their origins, and they are still deep in our souls. The echoes of our earlier innocence still reverberate, and the light that forsakes the evil one still shines. Our hearts can-and in their purity, do-desire that which is spiritual and holy rather than that which is \"carnal, sensual, and devilish.\" If that were not so, we would be in a hopeless condition indeed, and the idea of real choice would be jeopardized forever. We praise God our Father that our true heritage is of him and that by yielding and submitting to his eternal influence we can overcome the enmity which separated us from him and turn those gifts from nature to our blessing rather than our cursing.",

       {what:      "We are called mortal beings because in us are seeds of death, but in reality we are immortal beings, because there is also within us the germ of eternal life. Man is a dual being, composed of the spirit which gives life, force, intelligence and capacity to man, and the body which is the tenement of the spirit and is suited to its form, adapted to its necessities, and acts in harmony with it, and to its utmost capacity yields obedience to the will of the spirit. The two combined constitute the soul. The body is dependent upon the spirit, and the spirit during its natural occupancy of the body is subject to the laws which apply to and govern it in the mortal state. In this natural body are the seeds of weakness and decay, which, when fully ripened or untimely plucked up, in the language of scripture, is called \"the temporal death.\" The spirit is also subject to what is termed in the scriptures and revelations from God, \"spiritual death.\" The same as that which befell our first parents, when, through disobedience and transgression, they became subject to the will of Satan, and were thrust out from the presence of the Lord and became spiritually dead, which the Lord says, \"is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say, Depart, ye cursed!\" And the Lord further says, \"But behold, I say unto you, that I the Lord God gave unto Adam and unto his seed that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I the Lord God should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and redemption (from the first death), through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son. And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation; that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe; and they that believe not, unto eternal damnation, for they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall, because they repent not.\" From the natural death, that is the death of the body, and also from the first death, \"which is spiritual,\" there is redemption through belief on the name of the Only Begotten Son, in connection with repentance and obedience to the ordinances of the gospel, declared by holy angels, for if one \"believe,\" he must also obey; but from the \"second death,\" even that same death which is the first death, \"which is spiritual,\" and from which man may be redeemed through faith and obedience, and which will again be pronounced upon the wicked when God shall say, \"depart, ye cursed,\" there is no redemption, so far as light on this matter has been revealed. (See Doc. and Cov. 29:41-44.)<br><br>It is written that \"all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men\" who receive me and repent; \"but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven unto men.\" If men will not repent and come unto Christ, through the ordinances of his gospel, they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall, but must remain forever subject to the will of Satan and the consequent spiritual darkness or death unto which our first parents fell, subjecting all their posterity thereto, and from which none can be redeemed but by belief or faith on the name of the Only Begotten Son and obedience to the laws of God. But, thanks be to the eternal Father, through the merciful provisions of the gospel, all mankind will have the opportunity of escape, or deliverance, from this spiritual death, either in time or in eternity, for not until they are freed from the first can they become subject unto the second death, still if they repent not \"they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall,\" and will continue subject to the will of Satan, the first spiritual death, so long as \"they repent not, and thereby reject Christ and his gospel;\" but what of those who do believe, repent of their sins, obey the gospel, enter into its covenants, receive the keys of the Priesthood and the knowledge of the truth by revelation and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and afterwards turn away wholly from that light and knowledge? They \"become a law unto themselves,\" and \"will to abide in sin;\" of such it is written, \"whoso breaketh this covenant, after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come.\" And again, \"Thus saith the Lord, concerning all those who know my power, and have been made partakers thereof, and suffered themselves, through the power of the devil, to be overcome, and to deny the truth and defy my power--they are they who are the sons of perdition, of whom I say that it had been better for them never to have been born, for they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil and his angels in eternity; concerning whom I have said there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come, having denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father--having crucified him unto themselves, and put him to an open shame.\"--Doc. and Cov. 76:31-35.<br><br>Now, there is a difference between this class and those who simply repent not and reject the gospel in the flesh. Of these latter it is written, \"they shall be brought forth by the resurrection of the dead, through the triumph and the glory of the Lamb,\" and \"shall be redeemed in the due time of the Lord after the sufferings of his wrath.\" But of the others it is said, \"they shall not be redeemed,\" for \"they are the only ones on whom the second death shall have any power.\" The others, never having been redeemed from the first, cannot be doomed to the second death, or in other words cannot be made to suffer eternally the wrath of God, without hope of redemption through repentance, but must continue to suffer the first death until they repent, and are redeemed therefrom through the power of the atonement and the gospel of salvation, thereby being brought to the possession of all the keys and blessings to which they will be capable of attaining or to which they may be entitled, through the mercy, justice and power of the everlasting God; or, on the other hand, forever remain bound in the chains of spiritual darkness, bondage and banishment from his presence, kingdom and glory. The \"temporal death\" is one thing, and the \"spiritual death\" is another thing. The body may be dissolved and become extinct as an organism, although the elements of which it is composed are indestructible or eternal, but I hold it as self-evident that the spiritual organism is an eternal, immortal being, destined to enjoy eternal happiness and a fulness of joy, or suffer the wrath of God, and misery--a just condemnation, eternally. Adam became spiritually dead, yet he lived to endure it until freed therefrom by the power of the atonement, through repentance, etc. Those upon whom the second death shall fall will live to suffer and endure it, but without hope of redemption. The death of the body, or natural death, is but a temporary circumstance to which all were subjected through the fall, and from which all will be restored or resurrected by the power of God, through the atonement of Christ.",

When Adam, our first parent, partook of the forbidden fruit, transgressed the law of God, and became subject unto Satan, he was banished from the presence of God, and was thrust out into outer spiritual darkness. This was the first death. Yet living, he was dead--dead to God, dead to light and truth, dead spiritually; cast out from the presence of God; communication between the Father and the Son was cut off. He was as absolutely thrust out from the presence of God as was Satan and the hosts that followed him. That was spiritual death. But the Lord said that he would not suffer Adam nor his posterity to come to the temporal death until they should have the means by which they might be redeemed from the first death, which is spiritual. Therefore angels were sent unto Adam, who taught him the gospel, and revealed to him the principle by which he could be redeemed from the first death, and be brought back from banishment and outer darkness into the marvelous light of the gospel. He was taught faith, repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins, in the name of Jesus Christ, who should come in the meridian of time and take away the sin of the world, and was thus given a chance to be redeemed from the spiritual death before he should die the temporal death.<br><br>Now, all the world today, I am sorry to say, with the exception of a handful of people who have obeyed the new and everlasting covenant, are suffering this spiritual death. They are cast out from the presence of God. They are without God, without gospel truth, and without the power of redemption; for they know not God nor his gospel. In order that they may be redeemed and saved from the spiritual death which has spread over the world like a pall, they must repent of their sins, and be baptized by one having authority, for the remission of their sins, that they may be born of God. That is why we want these young men to go out into the world to preach the gospel. While they themselves understand but little, perhaps, the germ of life is in them. They have been born again, they have received the gift of the Holy Ghost, and they have the authority of the holy Priesthood, by which they can administer in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Though they may know but little in the beginning, they can learn, and as they learn they can preach, and as they have opportunity they can baptize for the remission of sins. Therefore, we want them to do their duty at home. We want them above all things to be pure in heart.",

Reconciliation, therefore, literally means 'to sit again with.'<br><br>Rich meaning is found in study of the word atonement in the Semitic languages of Old Testament times. In Hebrew, the basic word for atonement is kaphar, a verb that means 'to cover' or 'to forgive.' [We might even surmise that if an individual qualifies for the blessings of the Atonement (through obedience to the principles and ordinances of the gospel), Jesus will 'cover' our past transgressions from the Father.] Closely related is the Aramaic and Arabic word kafat, meaning 'a close embrace'-- no doubt related to the Egyptian ritual embrace. References to that embrace are evident in the Book of Mormon. One states that 'the Lord hath redeemed my soul … ; I have beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love' [2 Ne. 1:15].

Thus, when the laws of man have been violated, justice usually requires that a punishment be imposed, a penalty that will restore the balance.<br><br>People generally feel that justice has been done when an offender receives what he deserves-when the punishment fits the crime. The Church's declaration of belief state that \"the commission of crime should be punished [under the laws of man] according to the nature of the offense\" (D&C 134:8). The paramount concern of human law is justice.<br><br>Unlike the changeable laws of man, the laws of God are fixed and permanent, \"irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world\" (D&C 130:20). These laws of God are likewise concerned with justice. The idea of justice as what one deserves is the fundamental premise of all scriptures that speak of men's being judged according to their works. Alma declared that it was \"requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works\" (Alma 41:3). The Savior told the Nephites that all men would stand before Him to be \"judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil\" (3 Nephi 27:14). In his letter to the Romans, Paul described \"the righteous judgment of God\" in terms of \"render[ing] to every man according to his deeds\" (Romans 2:5-6).<br><br>According to eternal law, the consequences that follow from the justice of God are severe and permanent. When a commandment is broken, a commensurate penalty is imposed. This happens automatically. Punishments prescribed by the laws of man only follow the judge's action, but under the laws of God the consequences and penalties of sin are inherent in the act. \"There is a law given, and a punishment affixed,\" the prophet Alma taught, and \"justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment.\" Alma explained, \"And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence\" (Alma 42:22, 14). Abinadi added that the Lord \"cannot deny justice when it has its claim\" (Mosiah 15:27). By itself, justice is uncompromising.<br><br>The justice of God holds each of us responsible for our own transgressions and automatically imposes the penalty. This reality should permeate our understanding, and it should influence all our teachings about the commandments of God and the effect of individual transgressions.<br><br>In keeping with the legal traditions of man, many seem to want justice. It is true that justice is a friend that will protect us from persecution by the enemies of righteousness. But justice will also see that we receive what we deserve, and this is an outcome I fear. I cannot achieve my eternal goals on the basis of what I deserve. Though I try with all my might, I am still what King Benjamin called an \"unprofitable servant\" (Mosiah 2:21). To achieve my eternal goals, I need more than I deserve. I need more than justice.<br><br>This realization reminds me of an event that occurred in the law firm where I began practicing law more than forty years ago. A Chicago politician had been indicted for stuffing ballot boxes. A partner in our firm told me how this politician came to his office to ask us to represent him in his criminal trial.<br><br>\"What can you do for me?\" he asked. Our partner replied that if this client retained our firm to conduct his defense, we would investigate the facts, research the law, and present the defense at the trial. \"In this way,\" the lawyer concluded, \"we will get you a fair trial.\"<br><br>The politician promptly stood up, put on his hat, and stalked out of the office. Pursuing him down the hall, the lawyer asked what he had said to offend him. \"Nothing,\" the politician replied. \"Then why are you leaving?\" the lawyer asked. \"The odds aren't good enough,\" the politician answered.<br><br>The man would not retain our firm to represent him in court because we would only promise him a fair trial, and he knew he needed more than that. He knew he was guilty, and he could only be saved from prison by something more favorable to him than justice.<br><br>Can justice save us? Can man in and of himself overcome the spiritual death all mankind suffers from the Fall, which we bring upon ourselves anew by our own sinful acts? No! Can we \"work out our own salvation\"? Never! \"By the law no flesh is justified,\" Lehi explained (2 Nephi 2:5). \"Salvation doth not come by the law alone,\"Abinadi warned (Mosiah 13:28). Shakespeare had one of his characters declare this truth: \"In the course of justice, none of us should see salvation: we do pray for mercy\" (The Merchant of Venice, act 4, scene 1, lines 196-197).<br><br>We know from numerous scriptures that \"no unclean thing\" can enter \"the kingdom of God\" (Moses 6:57; 1 Nephi 10:21; Alma 40:26). If we are to return to the presence of our Heavenly Father, we need the intervention of some powerful influence that transcends justice. That powerful intervention is the atonement of Jesus Christ.<br><br>The good news of the gospel is that because of the atonement of Jesus Christ there is something called mercy. Mercy signifies an advantage greater than what we deserve. This could come by the withholding of a deserved punishment or by the granting of an undeserved benefit.<br><br>If justice is balance, then mercy is counterbalance. If justice is exactly what we deserve, then mercy is more benefit than we deserve. In its relationship to justice and mercy, the Atonement is the means by which justice is served and mercy is extended. In combination, justice and mercy and the Atonement constitute the glorious eternal wholeness of the justice and mercy of God.<br><br>Mercy has several different manifestations in connection with our redemption. The universal resurrection from physical death is an unconditional act of mercy made possible by the Atonement. Alma taught Corianton that \"mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead\" (Alma 42:23).<br><br>A second effect of the Atonement concerns our redemption from spiritual death. We are redeemed from the fall of Adam without condition. We are redeemed from the effects of our personal sins on condition of our obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.<br><br>Justice is served and mercy is extended by the suffering and shed blood of Jesus Christ. The Messiah \"offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law\" (2 Nephi 2:7; Romans 5:18-19). In this way, \"God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also\" (Alma 42:15).<br><br>We are all dependent upon the mercy of God the Father extended to all mankind through the atoning sacrifice of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. This is the central reality of the gospel. This is why we \"talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ . . . that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins\" (2 Nephi 25:26).<br><br>The reality of our total dependence upon Jesus Christ for the attainment of our goals of immortality and eternal life should dominate every teaching and every testimony and every action of every soul touched by the light of the restored gospel. If we teach every other subject and principle with perfection and fall short on this one, we have failed in our most important mission.",

       {what:      "One of the ways Satan lessens your effectiveness and weakens your spiritual strength is by encouraging you to spend large blocks of your time doing things that matter very little. I speak of such things as sitting for hours on end watching television or videos, playing video games night in and night out, surfing the Internet, or devoting huge blocks of time to sports, games, or other recreational activities.<br> <br> Don’t misunderstand me. These activities are not wrong in and of themselves (unless, of course, you are watching salacious programs or seeking out pornographic images on the Internet). Games, sports, recreational activities, and even television can be relaxing and rejuvenating, especially in times when you are under stress or heavily scheduled. You need activities that help you to unwind and rest your minds. It is healthy to go onto the soccer field or the basketball court and participate in vigorous physical activity.<br> <br> But I speak of letting things get out of balance. It is not watching television, but watching television hour after hour, night after night. Does not that qualify as idling away your time? What will you say to the Lord when He asks what you have done with the precious gift of life and time? Surely you will not feel comfortable telling Him that you were able to pass the 100,000-point level in a challenging video game.<br> <br> One devastating effect of idling away our time is that it deflects us from focusing on the things that matter most. Too many people are willing to sit back and let life just happen to them. It takes time to develop the attributes that will help you to be a well-balanced person.",
