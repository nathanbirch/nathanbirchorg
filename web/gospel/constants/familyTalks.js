 	 what:   'The Role of Women in Heavenly Father’s Plan  It is interesting how the topic that we are always assigned to speak on is not always the one we would be most comfortable with.  Today, being mother’s day, I have thought much about what the Lord would have me speak on.  I have thought about the role of my mother, and the impact she has had on me. I have thought about how Heavenly Father works through His children, but with mothers…He works through them in a very unique and powerful way, to the helping and saving of His children.  Today, on this beautiful Mother’s Day, I would like to speak about the role of women in Heavenly Father’s Plan.    Last October, Elder D. Todd Christofferson proclaimed,   "Most sacred is a woman’s role in the creation of life. We know that our physical bodies have a divine origin and that we must experience both a physical birth and a spiritual rebirth to reach the highest realms in God’s celestial kingdom. Thus, women play an integral part (sometimes at the risk of their own lives) in God’s work and glory "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." As grandmothers, mothers, and role models, women have been the guardians of the wellspring of life, teaching each generation the importance of sexual purity--of chastity before marriage and fidelity within marriage. In this way, they have been a civilizing influence in society; they have brought out the best in men; they have perpetuated wholesome environments in which to raise secure and healthy children."  (The Moral Force of Women)  From this we learn that the most sacred role is a woman’s role in the creation of life. This means bearing children, yes…but Elder Christofferson goes on to say that women are the wellspring of life.  This means much more than bearing children.  It means teaching and edifying all around you.  Truly, as he said, women have brought out the best in men and continuously help God in His work and glory. Women who strive to teach generations the importance of sexual purity, build righteous homes, and labor in the Lord"s work will receive His divine help.   There is a special woman in my life that I am continually amazed by who often talks about her desire to build a righteous home, and to teach children about the Savior and about the Plan of Salvation.  I can feel her burning desire to help our Heavenly Father in His work and glory.  And because of this desire, I fell madly in love with her.   Surely, women with such desires will receive instruction, guidance, wisdom, and strength from on high to do that which is most sacred before God.    President Monson taught, "If we are on the Lord’s errand, we are entitled to the Lord’s help."  I testify that there exists no other errand more important, or more sacred than that of being a mother.    My mother has made the most powerful impact on me in practically every facet of my life.  From teaching me not to jump off stuff too high, that I should eat broccoli and not try to hide it under the table, to teaching me that Jesus Christ lives.   One of the most powerful memories that I have is of my mother testifying of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It was around Easter time and I was with my mother alone in our home.  If I remember right, I started playing a song on the piano. It was the primary song: "Did Jesus Really Live Again." I remember my mom coming up to me and saying, "That was Jonathan’s favorite primary song."  Jonathan is one of my older brothers that passed away. She taught me, through powerful testimony, that because Jesus Christ lived again, I shall live again, and we all shall live again.  My mother’s love for me, and my other siblings, along with her faith and testimony, instilled in me a knowledge of the divinity of Jesus Christ.  This knowledge has brought peace and hope to my heart on countless occasions in my life since this precious experience. Her testimony, born to me throughout my life by her example and her words, brought me to yearn for a testimony like hers, and now continues to help me live uprightly before God.  Her righteousness has made all the difference in my life.  My dear sisters, do not underestimate your power for good. You are daughters of God with divinity in you.  You were called by Him long before this life in the pre-mortal realm to teach and serve this generation and to build up His Kingdom in these the Latter-days.  You are precious in His sight, and in the eyes of all who surround you each day.  Many times we all find ourselves lacking the kind of faith that we want or perhaps need, and find ourselves fearing one thing or another. One of my favorite scriptures in the Doctrine and Covenants helps me realize that we do not need to fear anything. The Lord is speaking to His missionaries. But surely, whom The Lord called to teach, nurture, strengthen, raise, and even create: mothers and righteous women; are defined as missionaries in the purest sense of the word. The Lord said,	  "87 Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds, and to teach them of a judgment which is to come.  88 … for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.  (D&C 84:87-88)"  In perhaps easier words to understand, "Be my disciple, and I will call you my friend." In other words, "Follow me faithfully, and I will always be there for you." I love my Savior.  He is endlessly merciful, and infinitely kind and loving. While life may seem daunting, He will help those who seek His help in righteousness.  I asked a special woman in my life about motherhood.  I think she explains well many of the difficulties and blessings of motherhood. She said,  "You don’t come home from work. You’re always on, hearing every sound, worrying, feeding, teaching, leading (hopefully by a good example), clothing, laundering, playing, reading, answering questions 24/7 relentlessly. We have to teach academics and gospel and behavior and manners… important things. And there’s never really a break!   Motherhood is also beautiful; relentless, but filled with reward. I get to take care of these sweet spirits entrusted to me by my Father in Heaven. I get to hear their sweet voices sing I am a Child of God and bear testimony of truths they have come to know, some that I helped teach. It is rewarding and humbling.   The Lord blesses me by letting me feel His love for my babies and by blessing me to love them as He does. Even in the hard moments, I can look at my children and be reminded where they came from, and how blessed I am to have them in my care and in my heart. Moroni 7 talks about praying to be filled with the love of Christ, with all the energy of heart. When I pray for help or patience or guidance or peace, and an open heart, He blesses me by filling it with love. Everything else pales in comparison. Love makes it do-able and a lot of times enjoyable, too.   Motherhood is the hardest thing I have ever done, and it is the greatest privilege and blessing in my life."  The Lord can make all the difference if we seek His help.  Elder Ballard said,   "There is nothing in this world as personal, as nurturing, or as life changing as the influence of a righteous woman."   -  Mothers and Daughters.  A righteous woman will be used in God’s hands for good.  A righteous woman need not fear.  We have all known righteous woman, and we have been touched by their love and positive influence. We should remember that no one is perfect. We should not judge others because their circumstances may be different, or because they live the gospel in a different way than we do. We should not judge others because their mistakes are a little different than ours. Every woman has a different role to fulfill before God.   Righteousness is not found in perfection, but in constantly striving to be perfect with an eye single to the glory of God. Elder Ballard taught,  I hope all of you dear sisters, married or single, never wonder if you have worth in the sight of the Lord and to the leaders of the Church. We love you. We respect you and appreciate your influence in preserving the family and assisting with the growth and the spiritual vitality of the Church. Let us remember that "the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children" ("The Family: A Proclamation to the World"). The scriptures and the teachings of the prophets and apostles help all family members to prepare together now to be together through all eternity. I pray that God will continually bless the women of the Church to find joy and happiness in their sacred roles as daughters of God. (Daughters of God).  All of us have a divine role to play in God"s plan. The Lord counsels,   	  "seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom, seek learning even by study and also by faith;  8 Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing, and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;  (D&C 109:7-8)"  We must diligently seek to know what personal role The Lord would have each of us fulfill while in this life. We all have the same commandments to follow, and no one is favored above another in our Heavenly Father"s perfect plan. But not all of us will end up with 14 children like the wonderful Lee family. Not all of us are meant to create children while in this mortal tabernacle. All of us have a specific purpose that we should seek to know and fulfill. All of us are children of a loving God who desires our happiness. To all of us, our greatest joys in this life will come from fulfilling our role in God"s plan. To us men, one of the most powerful ways that we can honor the Priesthood, is by righteously helping women fulfill their roles.  In closing I would like to share one more thing that Elder Ballard taught about motherhood,  "After observing and empathizing with three generations of mothers and thinking of my own dear mother, I surely know that there is no role in life more essential and more eternal than that of motherhood."  Motherhood is eternal and each daughter of God will have the opportunity of becoming a mother and raising righteous children. It is the most essential role in life.  I am so incredibly grateful for all of the wonderful mothers who are such powerful examples to us all.  I know that our Heavenly Father loves us perfectly.  I know that He gave us all mothers, and other righteous women in our lives to help us come back to Him. One thing that I have continued to learn in my few months of marriage is that women have an ability to love and show compassion that is unlike anything else in existence, except for the Savior’s love. I know that He lives.  I know that He loves us. I know that He has a wonderful plan for each of us, and that we should trust Him in everything. I know that families can be together forever. On this special Mother’s day, may we remember to thank the women in our lives for their examples and their goodness; and our Heavenly Father for His many blessings in our lives is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.   ',

 	{title:  'Testimony and Change',
 	 url:    'famTalks/docs/n2-testimonyAndChange.pdf',
 	 what:   'Testimony and Change Elder Oaks taught: 	"A testimony of the gospel is a personal witness borne to our souls by the Holy Ghost that certain facts of eternal significance are true and that we know them to be true." Today I want to talk about how a testimony can help us in our lives and what God wants us to do with a testimony upon receiving it.  President Eyring talks about us looking forward to a future day.  In one of his talks, he used the temple as an example…for us to look forward to the day we enter the temple and receive those ordinances.  He said, "If you can look forward to such a day with enough desire born of testimony, you will be strengthened to resist the temptations of the world. Each time you choose to try to live more like the Savior, you will have your testimony strengthened. You will come in time to know for yourself that He is the Light of the World. You will come to feel light growing in your life. It will not come without effort. But it will come as it grows and you choose to nurture it. Here is the sure promise from the Doctrine and Covenants: "That which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day." What I would like to focus on today, is how our testimony can help us receive more light until the perfect day. In the scripture that President Eyring just quoted, we learned that that which is of God is light.  We were all born of God, and are His children.  Every child of God was born with light in them.  What we do with that light will not only effect those around us, but our eternal destiny. If we receive that light, and continue in God then we will receive more light.  How can our testimony help us receive more light? Let us use an example from the scriptures.   Nephi is commanded of the Lord to build a ship.  With great faith, he does not complain, but rather asks the Lord,  "Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?" 1 Nephi17:9 With his exceeding faith, he knew that the Lord would help him.  So then, he asks his brothers to help him build the ship.  They mocked him and made fun of him for probably quite a while, and said that he was crazy and was a fool, and that they would not help him.  Then Nephi taught them about people in the Bible who were commanded of God to do great things.  He bore his testimony to them, "50 And I said unto them: If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done. 51 And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship?" We can see from this passage that Nephi was a man of faith, who acted upon his faith.  As a result of this, his testimony grew throughout his life.  It is easy to see that his testimony grew significantly between the beginning of the Book of Mormon, to 2 Nephi 31 when he teaches us of the doctrine of Christ. And while we study this passage we can see what opportunities he had to act and not be acted upon. A testimony is a powerful blessing that the Lord can bestow upon all His children, but a blessing that His children must seek earnestly to receive, and then work tirelessly to keep. A testimony is not simply a passive belief; it is a belief or knowledge put into action.  President Eyring said that a deep testimony will,  "shape your daily and hourly choices."  In my life, I am constantly trying to live the way that I know I should live.  Many of us have been members of the Church for quite some time now. Others of us may have just recently come in contact with the church. Many of us know gospel truths. Many of us pray earnestly to know God’s will in our lives.  The truth is all of us know more about God, and the plan He has for us, than most people who have ever lived on this earth.  If we take a moment to contemplate how much He has taught us through scripture, modern day prophets, through His Spirit, we will be overwhelmed with joy because of how much He has taught us about Him. But what do we do to show Him that we are grateful for this knowledge?  King Benjamin exorted, "And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them" (Mosiah 4:30).  Are the things we know reflected in how we live?  "Have we received His image in our countenances? (Alma 5:14). In the Miracle of Forgiveness, President Kimball taught, "In our journey toward eternal life, purity must be our constant aim. To walk and talk with God, to serve with God, to follow his example and become as a god, we must attain perfection. In his presence there can be no guile, no wickedness, no transgression. In numerous scriptures he has made it clear that all worldliness, evil and weakness must be dropped before we can ascend unto ‘the hill of the Lord.’" Is purity our constant aim?  Unfortunately for me, purity isn’t always my constant aim.  I’m trying to have it be, but it isn’t something that comes naturally or even easily.  It is difficult for us to constantly focus on eternal things while living in this carnal world.  To have purity be our constant aim, we must seek heavens help; we must vigilantly seek it, and we must receive the power of the atonement in our lives. Sarah and I were reading Step 2 in our addiction manual the other day and we read about grace. It says, "In the Bible Dictionary, grace is defined as ‘divine means of help or strength’ given through the ‘bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.’ This gift of divine strength enables you to do more than you would be able to do if left on your own. The Savior will do for you what you cannot do for yourself. His grace is the means by which you can repent and be changed." While discussing this phrase about grace in the addiction manual, Sarah said something profound that made me ponder deeply upon my own life, "With grace, these people who have serious, devastating addictions are overcoming them. And how many of us, who don’t have serious addictions, live our lives in mediocrity, not tapping into the power of the atonement?"  The atonement of Jesus Christ is for all people at all times. It is not just for the addict trying to find freedom from his addictions. It is not just for what we call serious sins.  The atonement of Jesus Christ makes it possible for us to become perfect. It allows us to become clean from all sin.  It allows us to become pure.  We must have the strength to use our testimonies to direct each hour and each moment of our lives in such a way that we receive the power of the atonement in our lives to the blessing and purifying of our souls.  Hebrews 4:16 reads, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." For us to receive grace, Paul said we must come boldly unto the throne of grace.  This requires work.  I imagine that to simply "come" unto the throne of grace would be to ask the Lord for help, and recognize our need for Him and His divine help in our lives.  I then imagine, that to "Come boldly" means that in addition to recognizing our need for Him in our lives, and asking Him for help; we also have the faith to change our conduct, and to do everything we possibly can to receive the grace of our Lord. Alma teaches us well what it means to come boldly unto the throne of grace, "Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism." -Alma 7:15 Today is the perfect day to do this. Today is the perfect day to re-enter into a covenant with our Heavenly Father. It is the perfect day to make a change, to get rid of a bad habit, or make a good new trend in your life.  In our lives, change can be difficult or easy.  If I invited the men in this room to go one hour without touching their face, and the women in this room to go one hour without touching their hair….it may be difficult for some, but with the proper focus and motivation anyone could do it. In our lives, our Heavenly Father doesn’t want us to merely change our conduct, He wants us to change our hearts, to become more like Him, to have enduring change that will last eternity.   I once heard said that each day is the first day of the rest of your life.  So what are we going to do with it? What are we going to do to show God that we love Him? For us to be able to lay aside every sin as Alma taught, we must use the atonement.  The atonement is the vital key to our repentance that allows us to grow closer to the Father and become more pure each time we are humble enough to use it.  For us to use the atonement, it also requires great work. We need to constantly be aware of our actions, our words, our thoughts, and our standing with God.  President Kimball taught, "There is never a day in any man’s life when repentance is not essential to his well-being and eternal progress…There is a prevalent, perhaps subconscious, feeling that the Lord designed repentance only for those who commit murder or adultery or theft or other heinous crimes. This is of course not so. If we are humble and desirous of living the gospel we will come to think of repentance as applying to everything we do in life, whether it be spiritual or temporal in nature. Repentance is for every soul who has not yet reached perfection."  	-Miracle of Forgiveness pg. 32-33. There have been times in my life where I reached what I will call, a plane of contentment.  I was doing good things, avoiding most the bad things, and because of where my mind was at, I was content   with my life and conduct.  I was not repenting often because I was perhaps too prideful to see or recognize my sins.  After some time I realized that my spiritual growth had been halted. I yearned to be closer to my Heavenly Father, but because of where my head was at, I was unable to see what I could change.  I began to pray more fervently. I wanted to be able to recognize my sins, all of them.  I prayed and prayed. Well, it didn’t take long.  I was down in the depths of despair because I realized that I was the worst and lowest human being on the planet.   Alright, it wasn’t that bad.  But the Lord really did show me what I had asked to see.  All of a sudden, I could not count the number of sins in a day, and I struggled to truly repent of some because they were habits, occurring multiple times daily.   I share this story, because it is common for us to be living on a plane of contentment. It is common for us to come to church each Sunday, but not truly ponder the sacrament or the atonement.  If we desire to be like our Savior bad enough, He will teach us how. If we seek His knowledge in faith, He will give it to us.   Repentance is a fruit of people who recognize their need for God, and have a testimony or at least a belief that He exists to help them.  For us to receive more light and grow brighter until the perfect day, repentance must be our constant companion.  Repentance must be our friend. In the Miracle of Forgiveness, President Kimball named several sins of commission that make us unclean,  "Murder, adultery, theft, cursing, unholiness in masters, disobedience in servants, unfaithfulness, improvidence, hatred of God, disobedience to husbands, lack of natural affection, high-mindedness, flattery, lustfulness, infidelity, indiscretion, backbiting, whispering, lack of truth, striking, deceitfulness, irreverence, boasting, arrogance, pride, double-tongued talk, profanity, slander, corruptness, thievery, embezzlement, despoiling, covenantbreaking, incontinence, filthiness, ignobleness, filthy communications, impurity, foolishness, slothfulness, impatience, lack of understanding, unmercifulness, idolatry, blasphemy, denial of the Holy Ghost, Sabbath breaking, envy, jealousy, malice, maligning, vengefulness, implacability, bitterness, clamor, spite, defiling, reviling, evil speaking, provoking, greediness for filthy lucre, disobedience to parents, anger, hate, covetousness, presumptuousness, abomination, insatiable appetite, instability, ignorance, self-will, speaking evil of dignitaries, becoming a stumbling block; and in modern language masturbation, petting, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and every sex perversion, every hidden and secret sin and all unholy and impure practices" (page 25). As I was reading this list by President Kimball, many things may have happened to us as individuals.  Some may have enjoyed hearing this list because they love the doctrine, but thought little of what it actually means in their lives. Others humbly thought about their own personal sins, and which of these sins could be found in their daily conduct. Some probably thought that these same things are always said in church and so hold little relevance in their lives.  Some may have become saddened, being overcome with a feeling of not being good enough, or being overwhelmed at the task at hand to become perfect.  I shared this list with you because we are all different and will respond in different ways when we hear prophets speak and perhaps when the Spirit counsels us to do something.  Satan would have us become saddened and overwhelmed with the quantity of our sins while our loving Savior would have us look forward with an eye of faith and joy.  Those who love the doctrine are in a good place, but it is better to love, understand, and know to apply doctrine.  Those who pondered in their hearts how they could be better, how they could change from hearing these things understand at least in part what it means to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, always remember Him, and keep His commandments.  With how imperfect all of us are, we should not be stressed or worried at the great tasks that lie ahead of us. Our Heavenly Father created us knowing that we would have to live in imperfection and He has provided the way whereby we may experience joy in this life, becoming better each day. We should not give up and think that that it is impossible to be live perfectly.  Instead we should, "Press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men" (2 Nephi 31:20). Our Heavenly Father loves us. We were created by Him so that we could one day become perfect and glorified as He is. His work and His glory are to help each of us receive all that He has. I know from personal experience that He will always do everything that He can to help us each day. We need not have fear. We need not be stressed about how far we have to come or how little and insignificant we may feel at times.  We must do today, that which will mean something tomorrow.  We must seek to live like Christ today, so that we can live with Christ tomorrow. With the precious gift of testimony that our Heavenly Father has given us, let us show forth gratitude unto repentance and witness unto Him that we are willing to take upon us the name of His Son even Jesus Christ. Let us lay aside every sin which doth easily beset, and come boldly unto the throne of grace. It is my testimony that as we do so, Christ will receive us as His and we will one day will live in the presence of our Father with our eternal families forever. In the name of Jesus Christ amen.  ',

 	{title:  'Revelation',
 	 url:    'famTalks/docs/n3-revelation.pdf',
 	 what:   'Revelation is defined as the act of revealing or disclosing; disclosure.  In True to the Faith, it is defined, "Communication from God to His children.  This guidance comes through various channels according to the needs and circumstances of individuals, families, and the church as a whole."   Why is revelation so important?  Joseph Smith said, "Salvation cannot come without revelation; it is in vain for anyone to minister without it."  There are many people in this world who would have you believe that the ability for an individual today to receive personal revelation is impossible.  They would perhaps take that a step further, and say that only a devil would claim to receive personal revelation.  However, revelation is entitled to each humble soul with a broken heart and a contrite spirit.   Constantly throughout our lives, we should each seek personal revelation in the things that we do.  But how do you receive this gift?  I remember my first time praying, trying to receive an answer…I had no idea what I was doing.   I knelt down and asked something…and just kinda waited like, "oh, this is dumb."  A few seconds went by and I gave up.  I wondered why nothing had happened, but I wasn’t too concerned with it at the time.   Then a short amount of time later in my life, I found myself greatly humbled and greatly pained, and I knelt down in prayer once more asking a question.  I asked my Heavenly Father from the depth of my heart, "Do you love me?"   I had never felt an answer to prayer before this, and it is rare even today that I will feel an answer so perfectly strong.  As I knelt there late that night, the Spirit filled my troubled soul with peace, love, and humility more than I could ever explain.  I was certainly not in a place where I would expect to receive revelation, but the Lord saw fit to tell me that He loved me, I just had to ask first. A servant of the Lord taught, "You need to seek and receive personal revelation through the Holy Ghost."  He continues a moment later, "Have faith that you will receive personal revelation to guide you from day to day.  The Holy Ghost will help you in every aspect of your work" (Preach My Gospel 90). I heard that and I was kind of overwhelmed.  I knew I wasn’t very good at receiving revelation.  But I decided that it was something that I needed in my life.  Each night I began to tell my Heavenly Father what I felt I needed to work on for the next day, then I would ask what He thought I needed to work on, to strive to do better the next day.  This helped me grow continuously for some time, and I became more and more familiar with the voice of the Lord.   Ezra Taft Benson taught the following, "The Lord will increase our knowledge, wisdom, and capacity to obey when we obey His fundamental laws.  This is what the Prophet Joseph Smith meant when he said we could have ‘sudden strokes of ideas’ which come into our minds as ‘pure intelligence.’…This is revelation.  We must learn to rely on the Holy Ghost so we can use it to guide our lives and the lives of those for whom we have responsibility." So, you go home from church today and you have decided that you are going to seek personal revelation.  It is very simple.  The Lord teaches us in Doctrine and Covenants 9:7-9, "Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me."  The Lord would not simply give something to us if we didn’t ask for it.  He knows that if we do seek and ask Him, then we learn and grow closer to Him.  It is how things are meant to be, and as we continuously ask for things pertaining to building the kingdom of God, He will grant them to us and we will become more Christ like.   The Lord continues and says in verses 8 and 9, "But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me." He is teaching us how to feel it, what to look for.  Now revelation comes by different means to each of us.  But just a chapter before this counsel, he teaches, "Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.  Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red sea on dry ground" (D&C 8:2-3). We have the privilege of that Spirit; the exact one, with the same power as the one who parted the sea.  At times it can be difficult to understand what the Lord is trying to get us to know or understand; faith is required.  Marion G. Romney taught, "We must study our problems and prayerfully make a decision, then take that decision and say to the Father, in simple, honest supplication, ‘Father, I want to make the right decision.  I want to do the right thing.  This is what I think I should do; let me know if it is the right course.’  By doing this, we can get the burning in our bosom, if our decision is right.  If we do not get the burning, then we must change our decision and submit a new one.  When we learn to walk by the Spirit, we never need to make a mistake."   What a powerful promise: "When we learn to walk by the Spirit, we never need to make a mistake."  There was a young man and he loved serving the Lord.  This young man took every opportunity that he could to serve, because he loved helping people, he loved following the Spirit, and he loved coming closer to Christ.  This man realized that his life was going unusually well.  It is not because there were no temptations, or troubling things in his life.  There were those things in his life, very prominently conveying their evil in his life.  But still…this man’s life was just about perfect.  He learned that the only times when he felt down, or when he really felt he made a mistake…was when he rebelliously disobeyed the Spirit.   I believe that it is important to hearken to the voice of the Lord for many reasons.  Not only does it have a profound impact on the individual who diligently seeks revelation and faithfully follows once it is given;  but it is also a responsibility that each of us have as members of the church.  Neal A. Maxwell, an apostle of God taught, "Perhaps our first mistake is to think that we own ourselves and also blocks of time.  Of course, we have our agency and an inner sovereignty, but disciples are to sacrifice themselves to do Jesus’ bidding with enough faith in God’s timing to say, in effect, ‘Thy timing be done.’ Now, what exactly does that mean…Thy timing be done?  Picture this, a twelve year old boy wakes up one morning and decides he is not afraid of girls anymore, now all of a sudden he really wants a wife.  So he rolls out of bed with a new mind set and gets onto his knees and starts praying, "Father in Heaven, please help me to find a wonderful wife today that will be perfect for me for all of Eternity.  I really want a wife and I think I’m ready for one, I mean…I know what girls are like and everything and I know I don’t need to wait a few years.  So I am going to go find one.  Please help me know where to go, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen." The Lord heard this boy’s prayer, and probably smiled from Heaven knowing that this boy’s prayer will one day be answered, but regardless of the boy’s perspective, the Lord is not ready for this boy to be married.  Imagine this boy, he went through the whole day…and didn’t find a wife.  He comes back and gets on his knees and says, "Why didn’t you help me find a wife?" This is a perfectly clear analogy of something that happens so frequently in a more subtle way.  Often times we ask for things, and we may not receive them, or even receive an answer to question until years later.  It is our duty to trust in the Lord, His ability to help us, and His timing.  The Lord is our Father and He loves us.  In addition to those two facts, He also knows everything there is to know, every thought ever thought, every name of every child, and everything in the future…He knows all.  And on occasion we have the nerve to say, "Hey…why are you doing this, I need this now?"  Now, I doubt that any of us would be that disrespectful when speaking to our Father, but on occasion, we are delivering a similar message.  When we fully understand our relationship with God, we will never question Him in such a manner, but rather faithfully submit to His will perhaps not knowing why. There are several principles that I would like to touch on today regarding personal revelation, and how to receive it.  The first is to be humble.  A moment ago I spoke about trusting in the Lord, when we are humble we acknowledge His hand working and we recognize our dependence on Him.  Moroni teaches, "Because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love" (Moroni 8:26).   The next principle is to keep the commandments which the Lord had given to you.  In the Sacramental prayer we learn that if we always remember Jesus Christ, and to take His name upon us, and to keep His commandments, then His Spirit will always be with us.  This is a covenant that we made with our Heavenly Father.  He promises us that if we are obedient then the Holy Ghost can be a constant and true companion to us.  D&C 63:23 says, "Unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysteries of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life."  This is another promise from the Lord that requires us to first keep His commandments. The next principle is to partake of the sacrament worthily.  A moment ago I briefly taught the promises in the Sacramental prayers, but why is it important that we are worthy?  If we partake of the Sacrament unworthily, it would have been better if we had not partaken at all.  The Sacrament is there to cleanse us, but if we knowingly partake of it unworthily, we are only condemning our souls.  In addition to that, the promises of this covenant are only in affect and therefore beneficial if we are first in accordance with God’s commandments…humble, obedient, and repentant. Another primary principle regarding personal revelation is the studying the scriptures.  We must be diligent in scripture study, searching them each day fervently and prayerfully.  I am not talking about reading one chapter each night when we are half asleep, can’t keep our eyes open and thinking about how tired we are; but actually studying.   A principle that True to the Faith mentions is taking time to ponder.  When we ponder the principles and truths of the Gospel, our minds and hearts are opened to the promptings of the Spirit.  When we take time to ponder, truths will be revealed to us that would not have been revealed otherwise.  We have to want it!  If you want revelation…it will take work.  Don’t think that you can say a 30 second prayer in the morning and expect to receive a multitude of revelatory answers…It will not happen.  Richard G. Scott said,  "Since it requires much personal effort to gain and use worthwhile knowledge, you cannot endlessly sample from every fascinating arena of life. Therefore, you should select carefully a few vital areas where you can focus energy to learn and share vital truths. I know that to gain knowledge of great worth requires extraordinary personal effort. This is particularly true when our desire is to obtain spiritual knowledge." We have to want it! Otherwise we will not receive it.  Constantly and consistently throughout the scriptures prophets proclaim, "Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto you."  I testify that this is true.  I have learned of the divinity of this simple principle from experience, from humbling myself before  my Creator and asking with a sincere heart and with real intent.  President Kimble taught the following, "The treasures of both secular and spiritual knowledge are hidden ones—but hidden from those who do not properly search and strive to find them. … Spiritual knowledge is not available merely for the asking; even prayers are not enough. It takes persistence and dedication of one’s life. … Of all treasures of knowledge, the most vital is the knowledge of God." As we ponder the words of the scriptures, let them sink into our hearts, we will be taken away from the trivial cares of the world and into a realm where miracles can happen, where the Lord is.  He always wants to help us, always wants to be with us, always wants us to learn and to grow…but we have to want it.  We need to look at our lives in a different perspective, and ask ourselves, "What do I want to get out of this life?"  As baptized members of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ himself, we are entitled to personal revelation and a constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.  Each week as we renew our covenants that we made at baptism, each week as we strive to live worthily, each day as we diligently  endeavor to be better than the day before, and each day when we humbly kneel in prayer we should say, "Father, Thy will be done."  How important are the little things in this life?  I want to save my money for a nice computer; others spend their time playing video games, watching sports, or any sort of television…WHY?!  Those things do not matter!  Video games are fun, watching sports is fun, tv can be good and relaxing, but when anything becomes an addiction it takes away from our ability to feel and comprehend the tender promptings of the Holy Spirit of God.  So we need to ask ourselves, "What do I want to get out of this life?"   I urge you to take time to ponder, be receptive to the loving Father in Heaven who wants to help you, seek and ye shall find.   The final principle I will mention today in regards to personal revelation is this, "Seek God’s will, and do it patiently."  I frequently find myself praying for specific things, things that are righteous desires, and I don’t understand why I receive the answers that come.  I think that my way is better because it can just seem so clear…then when I pray about it, there are times when I just get confused.  Why is this?  I like to think of it like a big old quilt.  So…this master quilter is making this huge quilt; let’s say that we can only see the bottom of it. From the bottom…I don’t really understand, I see these absolutely hideous colors going into this blanket.  I see this puke green, and some nasty browns, a few neon blues thrown in with the nasty browns, and then with random tinges of every color imaginable.  I am sitting there on the other side of this quilt thinking, "Alright, well…I sure hope this guy knows what he is doing, I’ll trust him."   In this situation, two things can be done…I can ask why he is doing it, so I can understand.  Or I can just sit there confused until one day…I will finally see the top of the quilt and vaguely understand how it all came together.  Life….is unpredictable, unexpected, difficult and full of surprises…to us.  Our Heavenly Father knows exactly what is going on, and we can have knowledge of eternal principles if we simply seek.  We must search for answers, pray for revelation daily, and live worthily to receive. When you do not receive an answer immediately, or not the one that you expected…be patient and have faith; He knows exactly what is going on.   Think about the brother of Jared, he went and inquired of the Lord.  Because of his exceeding faith, he saw the finger of the Lord, then…because of his perfect faith he saw the Lord himself.  And Jesus Christ said unto him, "And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast.  Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image?  Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image."     We must have faith.  If we have perfect faith, nothing doubting…there is nothing that will keep us away from our Heavenly Father.  Life…is an interesting thing.  One day, it will seem like a distant dream…with a million blessings or consequences resting upon the actions made herein.  We must have faith, we must be able to see the Lord every day of our lives.  Elder Holland’s prophetic words have sunk deeply into my heart, and will remain forever…he taught, "We have to move into the realm of the miraculous; we have to live in such a way where we cannot do it alone anymore – where we will resort to the Lord where we will cry, ‘Without thy help, I will fall.  Help me fly.’  Go to the edge where miracles happen.  Move into the realm of the miraculous."   Have faith! Have hope!  Seek diligently, and be obedient.  I know that as we strive to receive revelation from our Heavenly Father, we will receive.  We must follow these simple principles so that we can be guided by His hand, slowly back into his presence.  This is His Gospel and I am going to do all that I can to serve Him.  He is my Lord, my Redeemer, my brother, and my friend…without Him I am absolutely nothing, and without him I would be forced to endure an endless feeling of pain and sorrow.  I love my Heavenly Father, and I love Jesus Christ, I will serve them to the end, and it is my prayer that you will to.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.	 ',

 	 what:   'Mortal Life Talk   "When through the deep waters I call thee to go, The rivers of sorrow shall not thee o’erflow, For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, . . .   And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.   When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,  My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply.  The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design . . .  Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine. . . .    The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;  That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake, . . .  I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!" – (How Firm a Foundation)    People everywhere are afraid, are scared, are in anguish, are more than sorrowful, and some people…every day for them is painful and dreadful.  Why do they feel this?  What it really comes down to, is this, they need their Savior in their life, they need knowledge of Him, and hope in Him.     In addition to this thought, of having the Savior in ones life…which what mean is living His commandments and being worthy for the blessings of the Holy Ghost and blessings of the temple, but in addition, Boyd K. Packer said,    "Whatever your age, if you follow the right plan, you will be all right.  Come what may, wherever you go, whatever happens to the world, whatever trials you face, you need not fear the future.  ‘If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.’   I assure you, you need not fear the future.  You will be happy – if, that is, you follow ‘the great plan of happiness’" (Mine Errand from the Lord, p.5).   Well what does that mean?  Following the great plan of happiness?  I thought that the plan of happiness was just a sketch on a board with a bunch of shapes and long-worded labels.  But actually, Alma teaches us a little about the Plan in Alma 42,   "Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.   Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.   Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devlish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.   And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.   And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;   Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice.  Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God" (Alma 42:8-13).   He just taught that the Plan of Happiness can only be brought about on conditions of our repentance in this probationary state, or in mortal life.  The Plan of Happiness is in effect, but we are the ones who decide if it will change our lives.   Now about this life where so many people struggle, and so many people are harrowed up by the weight of the world, Nephi teaches in 2 Nephi 2:25,    "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."   We are on the earth…to have joy.  Why then, do so many people even in the church; who know about Jesus Christ, His commandments, and His true Gospel; live life being sad and depressed?  A good friend of mine, who I talk with frequently is one of these  people who is sad more than frequently.  Just about every conversation I will ask, "how are you doing?"  She will reply something to the effect of, "I’m ok, how are you?"  I will ask why she is only ok.  And she begins to expound on all of the stupid things that go on her life and how it stinks.  All the while I am thinking…why?!  Not, why do stupid things happen, but why do you let them bring you down?!     Satan has those stupid things in your life because he wants you to be depressed, he knows that if you are sad all the time…you are not a threat to him, you are like an archer on a tower without any arrows.  In addition to that, why should she let those things get to her?  She has a testimony of the Gospel, but apparently she lets those other things overrule the power of her testimony.  Because sure, this individual may have a lot of bad things going on in life that are out of her power, but happiness is her choice, and she can choose to focus on the Eternal perspective.   Doctrine and Covenants 122:7 reads,   "And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience and shall be for thy good."   Every single person who faces this mortal life while have trials and challenges, and I believe that people who are firm in their testimonies will receive even more difficult challenges because Satan doesn’t want them to succeed.  The Lord says that he will try his people, and He definitely does; through adversity.     I once heard of a family who was the happiest family you could imagine.  Each of them just loved life, and a lot of people didn’t fully understand why.  Some people thought that it was because this family had no problems.  Little did these people know; that years before three of the children in this family had passed away, and now the father of 9 children had a brain tumor which came as close as it gets to taking his life.  This tumor was the catalyst for another 6 brain surgeries over the next several years.  Mix those surgeries with cancer in various places in this man’s body…and you have a man who can no longer work, a man who has seizures sporadically and randomly.  This left the mother to go and support for the large family.  They struggled to break even for sometime…and still, through all of this they were the happiest people you could possibly imagine.   I am thoroughly convinced that happiness is an internal decision and is unaffected and unchanged by any outward circumstances regardless of how severe.  Why is this family so happy you may ask?  The Gospel is ever so prominent in each of their lives; the Savior is in each of their hearts; and the Spirit of God Himself is in their home.  The family knows that no matter what happens in this life…it will only be for a short time.  Even if the tumor did take the father’s life…it is not the end, because this family is sealed together in the House of God, by the infinite power of the Priesthood.     Happiness is not contingent on outward circumstances.  Peace is found from within yourself submitting your will to your Heavenly Father’s.  In another circumstance, there was a man…boy was he rich.  He had a home that was worth millions of dollars, he had a Ferrari, thousand-dollar suits, and he just enjoyed his rich life and the company he brought home each night.  But deep inside this man, who appeared to have it all, was anguish and despair.  This man couldn’t stand life because he knew something didn’t fit, he knew something was missing…and he never found out what.   We as children of God, and members of this church know the Plan of Salvation.  We have been taught about the glorious atonement of Jesus Christ himself, and we have been baptized into the church bearing the name of our Savior Himself on our countenances.  And yet so many of us go through each day grudgingly unhappy.   There was a time in my life where I was more than unhappy.  Like the rich man mentioned a moment ago…no one knew I was unhappy, that I hated life and wanted it to end…because I had given up all together.  I hated life because I knew that my life was definitely not in accordance with the Gospel, and a part of me knew the Gospel was true.  With this sin engrained in my soul at the time….it ate at my entire being bit by bit, and I was depressed because of it.  After some time of enduring this pain grudgingly, things started changed.  I finally turned to the Lord and His atonement.  Jump in the future a bit, and I was finally happy…infinitely happy, and nothing could bring me down except for my own rebellious actions if they were ever to return.   Happiness is contingent on our obedience, or testimonies, and our outlook on life.  If we believe that this life is it….and you get your car totaled and be bankrupt, you would be pretty depressed.  But if we embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, then we know that that does not matter at all; those kind of experiences are there to test our faith in Christ, and to bring us to Him, and in the most strenuous of tests…joy is still meant to be found.  This does not mean that life will be easy, but it is still meant to be enjoyed.    If happiness is contingent on our obedience, then why do so many people of the church willingly and knowingly rebel against the very God who created them?  It is my belief that it takes time for each individual to learn for themselves how to find happiness.  Life is difficult and full of trials, but when I see trials approaching me in my life I try to look at it in a positive light.   When I see something terrible coming at me, I am proud…because I know that I have passed every part of this Mortal test that has been given me, and I am coming up on the next page.  I am proud because Satan finds me of all people as some sort of a threat to his kingdom and his goals.  I want to be the kind of person that when my feet hit the ground each morning, and I humbly kneel in prayer…Satan thinks, "Oh crap, he’s up again."  I want to be the kind of person where when I kneel in prayer each morning my Father in Heaven is proud to say, "That is my son down there."   Sure, life is difficult; any synonym to the word difficult would be an understatement when trying to describe this life.  It is HARD!  Of course it is hard.  If it wasn’t hard…what would be the point?  One of my favorite feelings in life...is the feeling of overcoming something that was really difficult to do; that feeling of knowing that I did it with the Savior guiding me; the feeling of knowing that I grew closer to my Father in Heaven, because of this difficult thing in my life.  Out of every trial and challenge in life, there is always a lesson to be learned.     Our Savior, Jesus Christ teaches the following in 3 Nephi 27,   "And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil –    And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.   And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world."   Which part of our life will we choose to focus on?  When bad things to happen to us, will we think about how terrible life is, or will we think about the atonement of Jesus Christ that will always be there for us?  The atonement will always be enough if we let it work miracles in our lives.  So no matter happens remember the Lord’s promise to Joseph Smith,   "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;   And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high,; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes"  (D&C 121:7-8).   No matter what it is that is going on in our lives, it will only be for a moment.  We can do this!  We are children of Heavenly Father, and Spiritually begotten children of Jesus Christ.  We have divine potential to perfect like they are, and right now…we have the Holy Ghost to guide us, and their strength to uphold us if we come unto them with a broken heart and a contrite spirit.  Don’t be sad!  Life is wonderful, every day is a sunny day if you let it be.  Every day is a wonderful day…if you let be, and every day can truly be a joy even while living in this terrible world, because happiness is not contingent on outward circumstances.   If you have lost hope and feel that you cannot feel joy, that you are so far gone that it is helpless to even try…think again.  You’re here, and that says something about your internal faith.  And now think about these prophetic words spoken by Boyd K. Packer, an apostle of God,   "There is no habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no apostasy, no crime exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness.  That is the promise of the atonement of Christ."   There is always hope if you have a seed of faith in the things that really matter in this life: our Savior, Jesus Christ, our loving Father in Heaven, The Book of Mormon, the Priesthood and the Plan of Salvation.  Life was meant to be enjoyed, so dive head first into this gospel and start enjoying.   I once heard a story about this boy.  He was going through life each day…so excited to get to middle school.  He thought this, "I will be happy once I get to middle school…yea, that will be the day."  He gets to middle school…now his thoughts are, "You know, I will really be happy when I graduate get to high school."  He gets to high school, now, "I will really be happy when I can date."  His sixteenth birthday rolls around and he says, "I will be really happy when I am done with high school and just find a wife at college."   Jump in the future a few years, he graduated from college, is married with kids and thinks, "I will really be happy when the kids are out of the house and I can retire."  Pretty soon he is about 80 years old, and he is looking back on his life…and he sees a lot of missed opportunities, and a pretty empty life.  He wished he could have gone back and found some way to find joy while going through all of this, because for some reason…he never really found the joy he was looking for.     This man’s story is not a unique one.  At times we say things similar to this, "I will be happy when…" whatever it may be.  But that is not how it is supposed to be.  We are meant to be happy now, to find joy in the journey.  A man named Dan Millman said something I will never forget, "Be happy now, without reason…or never be happy at all."     I like this a lot because he clearly teaches that it is our choice.  He also taught this, "Pain is a relatively objective, physical phenomenon; suffering is our psychological resistance to what happens. Events may create physical pain, but they do not in themselves create suffering. Resistance creates suffering. Stress happens when your mind resists what is...The only problem in your life is your mind’s resistance to life as it unfolds."   This man was not even LDS.  And yet he could see that our mind has the power to choose…that we have been given that gift.  We have knowledge of the Plan of Salvation, the importance of this life, and the atonement of Jesus Christ that we can use in our life anytime we humble ourselves before our Savior.  Life will bring its surprises, but it is ok.  These surprises teach us who we are, and where we want to end up.  This life was not meant to be a waste of time, it was meant to teach us about our Savior, to teach us how to learn according to faith, to help us become like our loving Heavenly Father.  I know that this Gospel is true, I love it with every ounce of my being.  I love my Heavenly Father, and His merciful willingness to always forgive me when I screw up.  I love my Savior Christ who suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane thinking of me, Nathan Birch, and how his atonement would change my entire life, and save my soul from an everlasting hell.  He suffered for each of us, I know that He did.  I know that if submit our will to our Heavenly Father’s and faithfully follow him…all will be well, and we will never regret the decision to follow Him.  At times it may feel like our faith is but a small candle in a vast darkness…so helpless and insecure.  But you will find as you exercise that faith, as you step into the unknown, trusting in your Heavenly Father for your support, you will grow infinitely, and life will change.  You will come to know as I have that this life…is a joy, and this life is a gift from our Heavenly Father.  "IF thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of ally thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest" (Alma 22:16).  Give up your pride and serve the Lord always, starting with baptism and confirmation, then enduring to the end.  This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.   ',

 	 what:   'Love   “Master, which is the great commandment in the law?   Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.   This is the first and great commandment.   And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.   On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets” (Matthew 22:36-40).   Why is it so important to love?  Why is love the great commandment, to love the Lord and to love everyone around us?  First of all, I am not talking about romantic love.  I am talking about a Christ like love that He has for His brothers and sisters: us.     “Love is a feeling of deep devotion, concern, and affection.  Love for God and fellow men is a characteristic of disciples of Jesus Christ.  We manifest our love for Heavenly Father by keeping His commandments and serving His children.   Our expressions of love for others may include being kind to them, listening to them, mourning with them, comforting them, serving them, praying for them, sharing the gospel with them, and being their friend” (True to the Faith 96).    In my personal opinion, love is what this wonderful gospel is all about.  We are to be that light on the hill for all to see, we need to be examples for all, and especially we need to love everyone as Jesus Christ loves each of us.  I will say this, love is a gift.  For an individual to love everyone they meet is merely impossible, but with faith and prayer…all things are possible.  We need to recognize our relationship with those around us that may be our enemies; as sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father.    There was a point in my life where my older brother who is my best friend, was serving a mission.  He was gone and I missed him very much.  When he would write back, he would frequently teach about love, and how much he had changed on his mission.  And this was at the time that he had only been out about a month or two.  But he would tell us how amazing it was to pray for love in his heart, and to feel a Christ like love for all people.     I heard this several times and was convinced that it was something that I needed in my life.  I started praying fervently and diligently, hoping that I could start to feel this love, to have that blessing in my life.  After a couple weeks I realized that nothing was happening.  I decided that it wasn’t my Heavenly Father that wasn’t pulling through, I was probably missing something.  So I started to study my scriptures more, to pray more, and to serve more.  I changed the music I listened to, and the movies I watched so that I would be more in tune with the Spirit of God.  I continued to pray, and told Him of my goals and my challenges.  Then …gradually I felt a change.  I did start to love.  I would see people on the city bus while coming home from school, I would want to talk with them, want to help them, want to share the Gospel with them…because the Lord had blessed me with the ability to love.  It wasn’t long when I realized that I loved everyone I would ever see or meet.     When this happened, my entire outlook on life itself changed.  Everything just seemed so wonderful and full of opportunity, and it is because of love.  If I had not asked the Lord for this gift I would not have received.  If you are one of the many who believe that it is impossible to love everyone…pray about it with faith, ask and ye shall receive.  The Lord wants to help us, wants to bless, we just have to let Him.     Why is it so difficult to love?  There are so many wicked people who pollute our lives and we are supposed to love them.  We are supposed to love everyone, even Lucifer himself.  There was once a boy who struggled greatly with sin, he tried to pray to Lucifer one day and told him to stop making his life miserable.  He told him that he didn’t have to be like this; that he didn’t have to make everyone miserable because that wouldn’t help him at all.  For some reason, Lucifer did not comply with the tender boy’s humble request.  So the boy continued to pray to the Lord, asking for help in his endeavors.  Later in life, this boy had recovered from the struggling times and he proclaimed to God that he loved Satan himself.  This boy did not love him because he liked him or because he wanted anything to do with him; but because somehow, this boy could see that Satan was his brother, and the boy still loved him.  This boy plead with the Lord to help Satan, to forgive him if Satan was repentant.  Apparently it never happened.  But the joy that this boy felt in forgiving the very adversary himself was more than he could comprehend.  It truly was a gift from the loving God who created him.     It is so difficult to love because it is against our nature.  We are taught that love comes from strengthening relationships, liking someone…then growing closer to them.  When really, love is also found by realizing our divine relationship with every person we will ever see in this life.  The fact of the matter is every person you see is your brother or sister.  There is a part of them that wants to be loved, that wants to change, and that wants to be better.  There is a part of them that knows there is something worthwhile out there, and your love can help them find what that is.     Deiter F. Uchtdorf told an amazing story, and I will take a moment to quote him in sharing it with you today,   “An old Jewish legend tells of two brothers, Abram and Zimri, who owned a field and worked it together. They agreed to divide both the labor and the harvest equally. One night as the harvest came to a close, Zimri could not sleep, for it didn’t seem right that Abram, who had a wife and seven sons to feed, should receive only half of the harvest, while he, with only himself to support, had so much.   So Zimri dressed and quietly went into the field, where he took a third of his harvest and put it in his brother’s pile. He then returned to his bed, satisfied that he had done the right thing.   Meanwhile, Abram could not sleep either. He thought of his poor brother, Zimri, who was all alone and had no sons to help him with the work. It did not seem right that Zimri, who worked so hard by himself, should get only half of the harvest. Surely this was not pleasing to God. And so Abram quietly went to the fields, where he took a third of his harvest and placed it in the pile of his beloved brother.   The next morning, the brothers went to the field and were both astonished that the piles still looked to be the same size. That night both brothers slipped out of their houses to repeat their efforts of the previous night. But this time they discovered each other, and when they did, they wept and embraced. Neither could speak, for their hearts were overcome with love and gratitude.   This is the spirit of compassion: that we love others as ourselves, seek their happiness, and do unto them as we hope they would do unto us.”   He later taught that true love requires action.  In reality, love is an action word.  I could tell someone that I love them all day long…but am I willing to serve them?  Am I willing to put their happiness before my own?  Am I willing to share everything I have with them, to always be there for them?  The emotion of love is a gift from a loving Heavenly Father, but it is our responsibility and privilege to exercise that love and to share it with others.  I say the word privilege because the joy that comes to the individual who does love, who is selfless, who serves others and puts their needs before his own…is incomprehensibly infinite.  How can we ask God for the gift of love…exercise it, and not only be blessed for helping others, but also be blessed with more joy than we could have previously imagined?  Like I said, the Lord wants to bless us, but He cannot unless we submit our will to His, and let Him.    President Eyring taught,   “Love is the motivating principle by which the Lord leads us along the way towards becoming like Him, our perfect example. Our way of life, hour by hour, must be filled with the love of God and love for others. There is no surprise in that, since the Lord proclaimed those as the first and great commandments. It is love of God that will lead us to keep His commandments. And love of others is at the heart of our capacity to obey Him.”   It is interesting that the love of others is the primary point in our capacity to obey God Himself.  If I had to venture a guess as to why that is, I would say it is because loving others invites the Spirit of God into our life, brings joy to us, and brings us closer to Jesus Christ.  When we love others we have the love of Christ in us, and we want to serve Him and obey Him because of the joy we feel.     It is imperative that we love those around us, and equally imperative that we love our Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ.  The great commandment is to love God, and then to love others.  I do not believe that that order in the scriptures is a coincidence by any stretch of the imagination.  We must love God.  President Uchtdorf taught in a Liahona magazine,   “God the Eternal Father did not give that first great commandment because He needs us to love Him. His power and glory are not diminished should we disregard, deny, or even defile His name. His influence and dominion extend through time and space independent of our acceptance, approval, or admiration.   No, God does not need us to love Him. But oh, how we need to love God!   For what we love determines what we seek.   What we seek determines what we think and do.   What we think and do determines who we are—and who we will become.   We are created in the image of our heavenly parents; we are God’s spirit children. Therefore, we have a vast capacity for love—it is part of our spiritual heritage. What and how we love not only defines us as individuals; it also defines us as a church. Love is the defining characteristic of a disciple of Christ.   Since the beginning of time, love has been the source of both the highest bliss and the heaviest burdens. At the heart of misery from the days of Adam until today, you will find the love of wrong things. And at the heart of joy, you will find the love of good things.   And the greatest of all good things is God.   Our Father in Heaven has given us, His children, much more than any mortal mind can comprehend. Under His direction the Great Jehovah created this wondrous world we live in. God the Father watches over us, fills our hearts with breathtaking joy, brightens our darkest hours with blessed peace, distills upon our minds precious truths, shepherds us through times of distress, rejoices when we rejoice, and answers our righteous petitions.   He offers to His children the promise of a glorious and infinite existence and has provided a way for us to progress in knowledge and glory until we receive a fulness of joy. He has promised us all that He has.   If all that is not enough reason to love our Heavenly Father, perhaps we can learn from the words of the Apostle John, who said, ‘We love him, because he first loved us.’”   Not only is it a commandment to love Him, but it is a gift.  When we begin exercising our love for Him, being obedient to His commands, and willfully serving Him, we will experience more joy than ever before, and that joy will continue to grow as we let it.  This joy we feel is the pure love of Christ filling our souls.     Moroni eloquently describes this pure love of Christ when he taught,   “And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things” (Moroni 7:45).   Those are attributes of the love of Christ.  Earlier I taught that love is not only a feeling of emotion, but it requires action.  When Moroni described it he definitely had action in the forefront of his mind.  This pure love of Christ is patient, kind, good willed, humble, selfless, serene, pure, rejoiceth in truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, and endureth all things.  This love of Jesus Christ is not merely telling someone that you love them every day, this is only pure love when acted upon.  When each day we seek to serve, each day our thoughts are filled with purity and endowed with righteousness.  As we serve and as we love we will grow closer to our Father in Heaven each day without question.  President Eyring taught, “I hope you will go out today looking for opportunities to do as He did and to love as He loves. I can promise you the peace that you felt as a child will come to you often and it will linger with you. The promise is true that He made to His disciples: ‘Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.’”    What an amazing promise!  Even in this world of perpetual wickedness and endless temptation, the Creator of this world teaches, “Peace I leave with you.”  How can we feel this peace which he so tenderly offers?  Love.  We must love our brothers and sisters, put their needs before our own; as we do this it will become easier and more natural to do so.  At first, loving everyone, regardless of whom, may be difficult at times…but when fervent action is accompanied by faithful prayer, all is possible.  President Uchtdorf teaches a bit about love, he proclaimed the following,   “We increase our love for our Heavenly Father and demonstrate that love by aligning our thoughts and actions with God’s word. His pure love directs and encourages us to become more pure and holy. It inspires us to walk in righteousness—not out of fear or obligation but out of an earnest desire to become even more like Him because we love Him. By doing so, we can become ‘born again … [and] cleansed by blood, even the blood of [the] Only Begotten; that [we] might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory.’   My dear brothers and sisters, don’t get discouraged if you stumble at times. Don’t feel downcast or despair if you don’t feel worthy to be a disciple of Christ at all times. The first step to walking in righteousness is simply to try. We must try to believe. Try to learn of God: read the scriptures; study the words of His latter-day prophets; choose to listen to the Father, and do the things He asks of us. Try and keep on trying until that which seems difficult becomes possible—and that which seems only possible becomes habit and a real part of you.”   President Uchtdorf is an apostle of God, and he is teaching that our first step is a step of faith, and we must continue…until it is habit, and is a part of us.  If you don’t believe me then believe him when he teaches that love inspires us to be righteous, it cleanses, it purifies us, it strengthens us, and it leads us back to our Father in Heaven.     “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.   This is the first and great commandment.   And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”   We must love everyone as Christ did, and love Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father.  It is my personal opinion, that love is the first and great commandment because everything else falls into its significant influence.  If we truly love our Heavenly Father then loving everyone around us with a Christ like love will be natural and instinctive.  Which means that if we have a Christ like love then all other commandments will be followed willingly, just like President Uchtdorf taught.     In my talk today, we have discussed loving those around us, and loving Jesus Christ and our Father in Heaven; I would now like to speak on one final portion of love which is extremely significant especially at this point in each of our lives.  Howard W. Hunter taught,   “We need a more peaceful world, growing out of more peaceful families and neighborhoods and communities. To secure and cultivate such peace, ‘we must love others, even our enemies as well as our friends.’ The world needs the gospel of Jesus Christ. Those who are filled with the love of Christ do not seek to force others to do better; they inspire others to do better, indeed inspire them to the pursuit of God. We need to extend the hand of friendship. We need to be kinder, more gentle, more forgiving, and slower to anger. We need to love one another with the pure love of Christ. May this be our course and our desire.”   Let me reiterate one part, “The world needs the gospel of Jesus Christ.”  Members of this church are responsible to teach this Gospel.  Some may say, “I don’t know anyone to teach.”  Or, “I’ve already tried to teach everyone I know.”  Well then go make friends with more people.  Others may say, “It is too hard.” “It is too intimidating.” “I don’t know how.”  To this, I would say pray.  It is a commandment to teach this Gospel, and if you don’t know how, or you are scared…then pray.  Ask your Heavenly Father who loves you infinitely for help, for strength, and for additional faith in His ability to help you.  This world really does need the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  We are so fortunate, we have it in our lives, we know about the Plan of Salvation, we know the promises of the temple, the peace that our baptismal covenants bring, we know about the Priesthood on the earth today, and often times we take it for granted.  I say this because we do not share this Gospel enough with those around us.  Many would say that this Gospel is the best thing that has ever happened to them…and yet they talk with their peers about movies and celebrities more than they bring up the Gospel.  HAVE FAITH!     Like I said earlier, our Lord and Savior wants to help us…we just need to ask.  So ask with a faithful countenance, a broken hear t and a contrite spirit.  Ask faithfully.  Love is everything in this life, all good things are appendages to it, and all good things are accomplished through acting on love.  May this be our course and our desire.  In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.   ',

 	 what:   'Atonement The simplest definition for the word atonement is, “Amends or reparation made for an injury or wrong; expiation.”  Expiation means to make amends, to apologize.  In another context, the atonement means, “Reconciliation or an instance of reconciliation between God and humans.”  I would like to change that definition slightly, and say Reconciliation or an instance of reconciliation between God and His children.   When our Heavenly Father created us, He knew we would be imperfect beings.  He knew that we would sin, but He still loved us and wanted to be with us.  He provided a way that we could be together again, and that is through Jesus Christ.  I would like to focus a portion of my talk today on this scripture, 2 Nephi 25:23 it teaches,  “For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.” The first part I wish to speak of is, “To believe in Christ.”  Now, does believing in Christ just mean that we think He is real?  That we believe His atonement is real?  That we believe He is the Son of God?  What does that mean?  The word, belief itself means, “The mental act, condition, or habit of placing trust or confidence in another.”  If we are going to put confidence in another, in this case our Savior…we are recognizing Him for what He claims to be…that He is the only Begotten of the Father.   “That He came into the world to do the will of His Father, because His Father sent Him.” He continues, “And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil –  “And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me, that they may be judged according to their works.”  (3 Nephi 27:13-15). Now if you believe in Jesus Christ, if you believe in His atonement, if you believe that He can save you then the next part of 2 Nephi 25:23 is, “and to be reconciled of God.” It is interesting, in this scripture it sounds like it is our choice whether or not we will be reconciled of God.  In one dictionary, listen to the different definitions of reconcile, and while I am reading them, think of them in the context of our Savior, Jesus Christ and His atonement. “1. To reestablish a close relationship between.” “2. To settle or resolve.” “3. To bring (oneself) to accept: For example, He finally reconciled himself to change.” “4. To make compatible or consistent: For example, reconcile my way of thinking with yours.” That is from one dictionary.  So, in the context of our Savior Jesus Christ; the first is to reestablish a close relationship between…He is always there for us, so it is up to us if we want Him in our lives, if we want His love and guidance.  The next is to settle or resolve.  Jacob 4:11 reads, “Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.” To settle or resolve is speaking of our lives.  We need to come unto Him in the waters of baptism.  We need to constantly be repenting of our mistakes and our rebellious actions; we need to internally resolve to serve Him.  The next definition was to bring oneself to accept…to reconcile yourself to change.  We need to realize our relationship with God.  He is not a distant being who created just the mountains.  He is our loving Father who will be with us always if we just let Him.  David A. Bednar taught,  “As soon as we learn the true relationship in which we stand toward God (namely, God is our Father, and we are his children), then at once prayer becomes natural and instinctive on our part.” We need acknowledge our need for God in our lives, and come unto Him using the atonement of Christ every step of the way.   The next definition of reconcile is, “To make compatible or consistent: For example, reconcile my way of thinking with yours.”  This is so interesting; using the atonement of Jesus Christ in our lives to enable us to become more like Him.  Thoughts turn to actions, actions turn to habits, and habits show our true character.  With the atonement of Jesus Christ working miracles in our lives we can steadily grow closer and closer to God, and steadily become more and more like God Himself.  It is our choice what we do…it always has been.   Before this life, “You developed your identity and increased your spiritual capabilities.  Blessed with the gift of agency, you made important decisions, such as the decision to follow Heavenly Father’s plan.  These decisions affected your life then and now.  You grew in intelligence and learned to love the truth, and you prepared to come to the earth, where you could continue to progress” (True to the Faith, 116). It is our choice to serve God, to try to become like Him, and to utilize the atonement of Jesus Christ.  The next part of 2 Nephi 25:23 reads, “for we know that it is by grace that we are saved…”  Grace is a complex word with a lot of weight under it.  We are fortunate enough to learn about grace through the Bible Dictionary, it reads,  “A word that occurs frequently in the New Testament, especially in the writings of Paul. The main idea of the word is divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ.  It is through the grace of the Lord Jesus, made possible by his atoning sacrifice, that mankind will be raised in immortality, every person receiving his body from the grave in a condition of everlasting life. It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means. This grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts.” The last part of 2 Nephi 25:23 says, “After all we can do.”  To have the miracles of the atonement in our life, we have to give it our all.  We have to try our absolute hardest…then, after that He will help us.   Elder Boyd K. Packer said the following: “There is no habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no apostasy, no crime exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness.   This is the promise of the atonement of Christ.” An apostle of the Lord, says that there is absolutely nothing that the atonement of Christ does not act in.  This reminds me of Alma the younger, in Alma 36 after the angel had spoken to him, Alma said the following,  “I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more. But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins. Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments. Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror. Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.   And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul.   And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world. Now as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death. And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain.   Yea I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains.  Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy” (Alma 36:11-21).   That is a powerful story.  I wish I had time to teach the beginning of it in depth.  Alma the younger had gone about destroying the church, committing the most atrocious of sins…and like Boyd K. Packer said…there is no limit to the atonement of Jesus Christ.  In this story, first Alma the younger was humbled, and he was punished.  He was harrowed up by the pains of hell.  Does anyone know what a harrow is?  A harrow is a tool used in farming, it consists of a heavy metal frame with sharp teeth or upright discs that is used to break up the ground.  He felt that through the pains of hell…and then he remembered what his father had taught.  His father had taught about the very Son of God, satisfying the demands of justice, and atoning for all who would accept Him as the Son of God, and their Savior.  When Alma remembered this, and caught hold on this thought, and asked as sincerely as is humanly possible, he could feel the pain no more. The wonderful thing about the atonement is that not only did it take away Alma’s pain, but it also brought more joy to Him than he had ever felt.  The atonement when used in our lives will do the exact same thing as it did for Alma.  It will abolish our guilt, it will cleanse us of sin, and it will bring us closer to God, and make us happier and happier as we use it.  Each week when we partake of the Sacrament, we have the opportunity to utilize Christ’s atonement.  It is our choice, however.  Even if we take the Sacrament…if we do it while thinking about last night’s football game, or what shoes I will wear tomorrow, if we take the Sacrament without humble prayer, without asking sincerely for forgiveness, for this act to cleanse us of the wrongs committed since the last time we had renewed our covenants with God…if we partake of the Sacrament nonchalantly then it will do nothing for us.   The Sacrament prayer on the bread says the following,  “O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen” (Moroni 4:3). The effect of action on our part is to have the Spirit with us always.  To have the Spirit always means that we are worthy; it means that we have used the atonement.  In this scripture, it tells us how to use the atonement.  We must partake of the Sacrament…remembering the body and blood of Jesus Christ, witness unto our Eternal Father that we are will to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ himself.  This means that we try our hardest to be like Him, to do what He would do if He were here.  The prayer continues saying we always remember Him.  This does not mean that while we are trying to do a math problem in school we have to have the scriptures out that say all knowledge will be given to us through the spirit of Christ.  To always remember Him means that we constantly keep ourselves in check, we are constantly evaluating ourselves and our actions to see if they are in accordance with the will of God.  We do remember Him in all things, as we go throughout our days…thinking of what we can be doing better, how we can serve our brothers and sisters in this life, how we can bring them unto Christ.  And finally…keeping ourselves worthy of the blessings of heaven at all times, in all things, and in all places.  This is just my opinion on what it means to remember Him always.   Then the scripture continues, we need to keep the commandments.  I think that basically what this scripture is saying…if we truly love Jesus Christ, and our Heavenly Father, then we will have the Spirit with us always.  If we did truly love them, then all of this would be natural and instinctive.  Just like what Elder Bednar said about prayer…once we understand our relationship to God as His children, then prayer will become natural and instinctive on our part.  I believe that if we truly love God, and know God, then we will perfectly understand what it means to always remember him.  We will understand that we need to keep the commandments simply out of love, not obligation or guilt…but out of love.  John 14, Jesus Christ says,  “If ye love me, keep my commandments.   And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever…” Then in 23, “Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.” Our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love us so much that they are willing to let us choose for ourselves.  They are willing to put us through the trials and pains of life, Jesus Christ suffered for us, knowing that we would go through difficult times…simply so we can grow closer to Him.  They want to help us, they want us to find them, and they want us to know of them, and to love them.   The scriptures are tell us in many accounts from Matthew 7, to 3 Nephi 14, to Doctrine and Covenants 4, “Ask, and ye shall receive; knock and it shall be opened unto you. Amen.” Now in regular literature today, or in any persuasive arguments, or any magazine ad…anything, it is common sense that if something is repeated, especially more than once…then the campaigner really wants to get that point across.  In the scriptures, it says those exact words, “Ask, and ye shall receive; knock and it shall be opened unto you.” At least 13 times.  Not only are they trying to get the point across, but the prophets that wrote these Holy volumes of scripture are telling us that it is true.  So many different prophets…testifying of the exact same thing, “Ask and ye shall receive; knock and it shall be opened unto you.” If you are struggling in life, can’t seem to find your testimony with everything Satan is throwing at you, if you simply have just given up…then search your heart, and ask for help.  Ask for whatever you believe you stand in need of.  Do you need more faith, do you need strength to overcome trials.    I am telling you…the atonement has been performed for you personally; you just have to embrace it and let it be the lifeblood throughout the rest of your life.  We all need to have faith in Jesus Christ’s ability to help us.  We need to believe in Him as our Savior, and dive head first into this Gospel…and live it as children of God. Several years ago, I felt somewhat like Alma the younger.  At that point I didn’t think of it as being racked and harrowed up with the pains of hell, but I know that I hated everything about life, I hated myself and what I was doing.  I even hated the Gospel, because a part of me knew it was true…and knew it was condemning me.  This pain and anguish went on for several years, to the point where I was contemplating suicide.  It got to the point where just about every day I would break down crying…because I had given up.  I didn’t think there was any hope.  I didn’t believe in the promise found in 1 Corinthians 10:13 that says the Lord will make a way to escape the temptation.  So suicide was my only choice left, simply because I wanted to be away from this earth and the pains that were so prominent in my life.  I thought it would help because it would get me away from what I had been struggling so severely with.  Something kept keeping me here though.  Finally something happened…something big.  And I didn’t feel like my Heavenly Father was a distant God judging me for my weaknesses any more, I felt like He was a loving Heavenly Father who wanted nothing more to help me.   I prayed more sincerely than I ever had before, telling Him that I needed Him more than anything, and I knew it.  The more I prayed and read my scriptures…I could see more change in my life.  It was like the sun was finally coming out after a storm that had blackened my life for years.  I could start to see hope as I could feel the atonement working such apparent miracles in my life.  I started to really grow, and to love the Gospel, and to strengthen my testimony that was so deeply rooted inside of me.  I soon became worthy to bear the Priesthood which I had held for several years, I became worthy to go into the temple, I became worthy to partake of the Sacrament, and partake of the blessings of Heaven.  I was on the path of Eternal Life.  The Lord saw fit to help me, when I needed His help the most.  Since then, I have had my ups and downs, but am steadily growing more like Christ. It is interesting because this in this story I was so prideful and so faithless that the Lord couldn’t do anything to help me, because I have agency.  But when I let Him into my life…when I was about to give up everything…He helped me immediately.  Our God is a fourth watch God.  This time that I spent in pain, helped me realize how wonderful life really is.  Like Alma, nothing had been more excruciating than my pain, and nothing has been so amazing than my joy.  In this time I learned many lessons that have proved to be directly applicable to the majority of challenges in my life.  My Heavenly Father knew what was going to come of this, He knew that eventually I would come to Him…but there were things I needed to learn first.  My Heavenly Father didn’t enjoy my pain, and Jesus Christ certainly didn’t enjoy suffering for my stupid actions…but they both had hope for me, and that is why they bore my pains with me…because they love me, and they want me to be with them.                   Bruce R. McConkie taught that the atonement of Jesus Christ is the most basic and fundamental doctrine of the Gospel, but we know the least about it.  I think that it is interesting, because it requires faith to believe in the effects of the atonement.  Without the atonement…nothing would matter.  Without the atonement we would not be able to overcome death, we would never have the fullness of joy…becoming like our Father in Heaven and receiving Exaltation.  Without the atonement we could never know happiness.  But still, we know very little about it.  We know, “As Adam brought death, so Christ brought life; as Adam is the father of mortality, so Christ is the father of immortality. And without both, mortality and immortality, man cannot work out his salvation and ascend to those heights beyond the skies where gods and angels dwell forever in eternal glory.” Bruce R. McConkie.   James E. Talmage taught, “The atonement was plainly to be a vicarious sacrifice, voluntary and love-inspired on the Savior’s part, universal in its application to mankind so far as men shall accept the means of deliverance thus placed within their reach.  For such a mission only one who was without sin could be eligible…Jesus Christ was the only Being suited to the requirements of the great sacrifice: 1 – As the one and only sinless Man; 2 – As the Only Begotten of the Father and therefore the only Being born to earth possessing in their fulness the attributes of both Godhood and manhood; 3 – As the One who had been chosen in the heavens and foreordained to this service. What other man has been without sin, and therefore wholly exempt from the dominion of Satan, and to whom death, the wage of sin, is not naturally due?  Had Jesus Christ met death as other men have done – the result of the power that Satan has gained over them through their sins – His death would have been but an individual experience, expiatory in no degree of any faults or offenses but His own.  Christ’s absolute sinlessness made Him eligible, His humility and willingness rendered Him acceptable to the Father, as the atoning sacrifice whereby propitiation could be made for the sins of all men.  What other man has lived with power to withstand death, over whom death could not prevail except through his own submission?  Yet Jesus Christ could not be slain until His ‘hour had come,’ and that, the hour in which He voluntarily surrendered His life, and permitted His own decease through an act of will.  Born of a mortal mother He inherited the capacity to die; begotten by an immortal Sire He possessed as a heritage the power to withstand death indefinitely.  He literally gave up His life; to this effect is His own affirmation: ‘Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.  I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.’  And further: ‘For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in Himself.’  Only such a One could conquer death; in none but Jesus Christ was realized this requisite condition of a Redeemer of the world.” Now, in our lives today, how can who apply this?  How can we have the sufficient faith to simply believe in the atonement and its infinite power?  I have several scriptures to share, to assist in teaching how we can perfectly know.   The first is James 1:5, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.  For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”   So…if we lack wisdom, ask God for knowledge…with faith.  There is that action word again: faith.  How do you have faith?  In this context ask yourself, “Do I believe in God, or do I believe that we evolved from monkeys and there was no Supreme Being who created everything?”  Do you believe that He, the one who created all, is able to give you knowledge regarding anything you prayerfully and humbly seek?  Do you believe that He loves you and wants to help you?  Do you believe that the scriptures were written by prophets who were very in tune with the Spirit, and the scriptures are the words of God himself?   If ye lack wisdom...ask for help.  If you don’t have faith, and you wish you had more…ask for help?  3 Nephi 14:7-8 says, “Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.” Sincerely get down on your knees and just ask for help, ask for guidance, and you will receive it.   When you do this, whatever answer you receive…do not stop there.  The first step to growth…is knowledge, the second step is action.  If you are standing there and you move your right foot forward…you still haven’t moved, until you lift your left food and move in front.  Action is required.  If you receive an answer to any prayer that you aren’t expecting and you don’t know what to do, think about this scripture,  “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths” (Proverbs 3:5-6). Jesus Christ teaches us in Isaiah, “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For s the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts” (Isaiah 55:8-9). The scriptures are here for our learning and our benefit.  There are countless stories that directly relate to our lives and how we can grow closer to our Savior.  Is it really so hard to study the scriptures each day?  I am not talking about reading 5 verses after your 14 hour day while you are laying in bed with your eyes half closed and 90% of your regular consciousness is completely non-existent.  Seriously think about this, in our lives…a lot of the time the scriptures are not put in first.  Some spend more time on facebook, some spend more time watching tv, sports, or movies.  Some spend more time putting on their makeup; some spend even more time in the shower.  My point is…why do we underestimate the Divine power of the scriptures and the impact they have in our lives.  Our lives are like pizza.  The scriptures…are the very dough of the pizza.  Everything else…like makeup, showers, movies, facebook, sports, work…whatever it is…those are like the pepperoni, the green peppers, all of the things that come after the dough.  Without the dough…your pizza will be falling apart.  Without a steady and constant input of Divine knowledge and the Spirit put into your life…it will fall apart.  The scriptures, the Ensign, General Conference talks, prayer…where we pray seeking personal revelation…these things are absolutely imperative for growth.   I learned a valuable lesson just recently.  I will tell you a brief story. So, for some time now I have been praying to be able to love my scriptures.  Each morning I would wake up…read a chapter and call it good.  I rarely thought twice about what I had read and I was just kind of putting along.  But I really didn’t enjoy reading my scriptures.  I loved my scriptures, I taught people with them, they would strengthen me when I needed it…but I didn’t really dive in and search the scriptures daily like I should.  Then, just recently I started a new way of studying.  Each day before this way of studying I would pray for an abundance of His Spirit, I would pray for His love, and for help as I tried to grow through the scriptures.  This new way of studying enabled me to completely immerse myself in not only the scriptures, but general conference talks, wonderful church literature, so many things…and I did this every day.  After about a week…I realized that I had done twice the amount of studying as I had previously anticipated…and I wanted more.   Finally, I had started loving the scriptures.  It wasn’t out of obligation or selfish reasons that I read a chapter each morning or a chapter each night.  But I actually loved them and wanted to be in them.  As I continue this each day, my love for them grows stronger and stronger.  Likewise, I can feel my faith in my Savior strengthening, my ability to resist temptation, strengthening, and the love I feel for everyone…strengthening.   This is all because I humbly prayed for help and guidance.  But that wasn’t all; when I had prayed so many times before for this, nothing ever happened.  It only happened when I prayed humbly for help …and did all I could to have Him answer my prayer.   In our lives, we need to help our Heavenly Father answer our prayers.  It is like saying, I want to be astronaut.   But you drop out of school your sophomore year and you don’t care.  You still keep wishing you were an astronaut; you keep even keep praying that you become an astronaut.  But instead you are just going through everyday sitting at a computer at a minimum wage job, and then you go home and eat food while watching tv.  He isn’t going to just send a space shuttle to your back yard and say hop on.  If you really want to be an astronaut….it will take effort on your part.   It is like asking for missionary experiences, but when you have the feeling to open your mouth you don’t do it.  HE LOVES US AND WANTS TO HELP US!!!  We just have to open the door, we just have to have faith, and work for it.   The atonement of Jesus Christ is in place, and He wants us to use it.  It can be difficult at times, and sometimes it may seem utterly impossible to change and become better.  But I testify that the atonement of Jesus Christ works miracles in my life every time I let it.  It has such unfathomable power that is incomparable to anything else in existence.  We cannot understand it, but we can have faith and knowledge of its power.  We also must have faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ Himself.  He said, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shell find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light” (Matthew 11:28-30). This is talking about the atonement.  Don’t suffer when you don’t have to, just ask Him for help, for forgiveness, for His Spirit to cleanse you.  You will come to know that the atonement is very real, and it will change your life. I testify with Bruce R. McConkie when he says,  “In a coming day I will feel the nail marks in his hands and in his feet and shall wet his feet with my tears.  But I shall not know any better then than I know now that He is God’s almighty Son, that he is our Savior and Redeemer, and that salvation comes in and through His atoning blood and in no other way. God grant that all of us may walk in the light as God our Father is in the light so that, according to the promises, the blood of Jesus Christ his Son will cleanse us from all sin.” These things have been made known unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost which the Lord has so willingly and trustingly bestowed upon me.  I am forever grateful for His atoning sacrifice, and I say these things in His sacred name, even Jesus Christ.  Amen. ',

 	 what:   'Adversity In the Gospel reference, “True to the Faith,” it clearly teaches about what adversity is.  It says the following,  “As part of Heavenly Father’s plan of redemption, you experience adversity during mortality.  Trials, disappointments, sadness, sickness, and heartache are a difficult part of life, but they can lead to spiritual growth, refinement, and progress as you turn to the Lord.” Many people wonder why adversity is present in each person’s life, and especially in each good person’s life.  People will say, “Why is this happening to me, why me of all people?”  The truth of the matter is, we grow through adversity.  That is what adversity is there for.  Hosea 5:15 reads, “I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.”  In that scripture it is speaking of pride.  When everything is going wonderfully in life, at times we forget the simple things like getting down on our knees in prayer each morning.  The Lord knows that with adversity we will turn to him. I look into my life, and see the infinite number of trials, challenges, and adversities that I have had to deal with.  Then I think about how thankful I am for them.  When I look back, I can see the Lord’s hand in my life in when I did not know it was present.  When I look back I can see how much one simple trial had changed me, and helped me grow closer to my Savior.  Now anytime I have a challenge, I might be a little nervous or scared, but I know that the Lord  has a plan for me…and that this is going to be a good thing.  In Doctrine and Covenants 122 Joseph Smith is being held at liberty jail and to say the least, he isn’t feeling very well.  He is wondering why this is happening to him, when the church needs him so much.  The Lord answers and says in verses7-9,  “And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens gather blackness, and all the elements combine to hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee, know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all.  Art thou greater than he? Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass.  Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.” The Lord knows how we feel, and He knows that adversity is extremely difficult for us.  But if we could manage to hold in our hearts and minds the real purpose of adversity…we would shout for joy when confronted by it.  Adversity helps us grow closer to God, to become more like Christ.  Adversity humbles us when necessary so we turn to God and acknowledge his supremacy.  If we could always remember that, when faced with it would have our heads held high knowing that what is coming could be difficult, but in no ways impossible, and in every way a wonderful opportunity.   True to the Faith continues teaching about adversity, and says the following, “Adversity comes from different sources.  You may at times face trials as a consequence of your own pride and disobedience.  These trials can be avoided through righteous living.  Other trials are simply a natural part of life and may come at times when you are living righteously.  For example, you may experience trials in times of sickness and uncertainty or at the deaths of loved ones.  Adversity may sometimes come because of others’ poor choices and hurtful words and actions.” I would like to magnify the first mentioned source of trials, facing trials as a consequence of your own pride and disobedience.  In our life, we have agency.  As we make decisions in everyday life, we are forced to choose between the powers of Heaven powers of Hell.  If at one point in life, you choose to follow Satan…even for just a moment, a lot can happen.  First of all, a tiny bit of your agency is taken from you.  As you continue to be disobedient to God you will slowly draw further from him into the captivity of Hell.  As this happens, your agency is becoming more and more limited.  Addictions may arise, guilt will be present, hate, and remorse may be prominent emotions, and with all of this, your ability to choose for yourself happiness and God is much more limited than you ever thought it could be.  2 Nephi 26:22 reads, “And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.” This scripture clearly depicts the principle I was just teaching.  We don’t see it happen automatically, but think about your personal life…are there little things in it that are on the road to bigger things?  Matthew 6:24 reads, “No man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”  Likewise, all things in life are either evidence of God, and prove that He is, or are evidence of Satan and his endless hate for all of us here on earth.  There is no middle ground.   In my life, I think of the simplest things that could represent that gentle and imperceptible flaxen cord.  I think about music.  Are there songs that are contrary to the standards of God?  Am I in a position to feel the Spirit when I listen to any of the songs on my iPod?  I will think about other media, such as movies, or video games.  If there is anything in them contrary to the commandments of God, I should just get rid of them.  Because as I let that evil spirit in…in will slowly work on me like rusting metal and I will ever so slowly distance myself from God, grow closer to Satan, lose my agency, and become miserable.  Boyd K. Packer taught the following,  “The Apostle Paul said: ‘If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.’  If our view is limited to mortal life, some things become unbearable because they seem so unfair and so permanent.  There are doctrines which, if understood, will bring a perspective toward and a composure regarding problems which otherwise have no satisfactory explanations.” I thought a lot into this teaching and thinking about how significant the doctrines of the Gospel are when facing adversity.  The most simple, is just knowing that this life is but I tiny thread in the grand tapestry of eternity.  If we can hold an Eternal perspective in our everyday life, then we will see things for what they really are.  With an Eternal perspective it would be easy to throw away vulgar or offensive media.  It would be easy to serve others, to go out with the missionaries, to pay tithing, to keep the word of wisdom and the law of chastity.  If we could keep the image of our Savior Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father, waiting for us to come home where we will live together for all of Eternity then every challenge that we face will make sense and will be not only possible, but positive and enjoyable.  This is what is meant by an eye of faith, or our spiritual eyes.    True to the Faith touches on this principle, it says the following,  “When you trust in the Father and the Son, you are confident that They love you perfectly – that They want you to be happy and that They will help you grow spiritually.  You keep the commandments.  You seek to know Their will, and you do what They require even when you desire something else.  Your prayers for relief are accompanied by the understanding that Heavenly Father will not resolve all matters immediately – that He may allow you to wait so you can continue to learn and grow.  Through it all, you find comfort in the assurance that the Savior understands your trials perfectly.  As part of His infinite Atonement, He took upon Himself ‘the pains and the sicknesses of his people.’  He took upon Himself ‘their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.’  Because He has experienced your pain, He knows how to help you.  If you look to Him in faith, He will strengthen you to withstand any trial you experience.” In times of trial and tribulation, remember what Joseph Smith said in Doctrine and Covenants 58:2-4,  “He that is faithful in tribulation, the reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of heaven. Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation. For after much tribulation come the blessings.” It is interesting because God knows we will have challenges, He permits them knowing that they will bring us to Him if we let it.  Jesus Christ suffered for those pains for us to grow closer to Him.  These challenges are for our benefit.  But many times in life we see people that are absolutely miserable because they have let the trials in their lives give them the excuse to be depressed, or to give up all together.  But at the same time as all of these challenges…Man is that he might have joy.  The Lord knows that we can experience joy while in the midst of trial and affliction, but that is up to us.  Mosiah 7:33 reads, “But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.” This scripture could relate to the repentance process, or the strength to resist temptation, or it could even relate to just happiness and sadness.  If we will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, put our trust in him, serve him with all diligence of mind…He will be there for us.  He will deliver us out of bondage, strengthen us, and uphold us by our righteousness.  D&C 38:1-2 reads, “Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, the Great I AM, Alpha and Omega…The same which knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes.” All things were present before His eyes when he, through his prophet said, man is that he might have joy.  Finding joy in adversity can definitely be extremely difficult, but it is possible, and the closer we grow to God…the more natural it becomes.   Sometimes I like to think of my trials and challenges of life in a unique light.  To explain this, I will use a short story. There was a teenage girl.  She comes home one day from school, and her mother is just sitting on the floor leaning against the wall.  Now usually her mother is always in motion, always doing something…so this really caught the daughter off guard.  She walks up to her dazed-eyed mother and hesitantly said, “Mom….”  Nothing happened.  So she stood there for a moment just wondering what is going on, and finally asks, “Mom…what’s wrong?”  After a moment, the mother said, “Nothing.”  Now the teenage girl is really confused.  I can just picture what is going through her head, “What the heck are you doing on the floor then if…nothing is wrong?!”  After another moment of thought the daughter asked, “Well what do you mean nothing is wrong?”  And the mother said, “That is exactly the problem…nothing is wrong.  Everything went perfectly smoothly today.  Nothing even slightly bad happened, no one said anything to annoy me…absolutely nothing is wrong, that’s the problem.”  The daughter’s brain is going a hundred miles an hour…still wondering what the heck is wrong with that.  She just waits for a moment for her mother to explain herself further.  Finally the mom gave the answer to her daughter’s internal question, “If absolutely nothing bad happened to me, and nothing bad is going on still…then Satan thinks I am in his back pocket and he doesn’t have to work on me.” So now in my life I think very frequently in a context similar to that.  If there is a trial ... that is the hardest thing I can possibly imagine, then I think, “Alright, I must be doing something good because Satan wants me to fall more than usual.”  With that train of thought, I dive into the scriptures head first, I pray fervently and I follow the instruction in Mosiah 7:33.  Then I can feel the Lord strengthening me…I can actually feel it.  I become impenetrable because of the strength of the Lord, and I know that nothing can get to me.  So with a difficult challenge…I grow so much.  At times that growth will leave me with pride, and I won’t study or pray as much as I need to, so I need to be humbled again.  It seems like an endless cycle sometimes.  But when I do stick to what I know, when I find a way to balance the many things in life in such a way where scripture study is an essential part of my day…I just constantly grow closer to God.   I imagine this is how it will be until I am perfect like Christ, which is a ways down the road…but I’m on the road headed in the right direction.   In the Book of Mormon, there is an account of a people in bondage that are suffering under a cruel ruler.  They lifted their hearts and voices to God, asking for help, and He replied, “Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage. And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.”  That is found in Mosiah 24:13, 14, and 25. The people then had faith in the words of the Lord and the power of the Lord and their burdens were made light.  In our lives today we can be like these people and submit cheerfully with patience to all the will of the Lord.   We can have faith in His plan for us even though it is unclear at times, and with Him helping us we can go through the stormy days in life with joy, then reap the blessings of the sunny days in His presence for all of eternity.   It is an interesting thing, because adversity is defined by the world as, “A state of hardship or affliction; a misfortune.”  I agree that adversity can definitely be a hardship and afflictions as well.  But a misfortune…that is an interesting thought.  The majority of people on the planet would see adversity as a misfortune.  However, if you are in tune with the Spirit and are living in accordance to our Heavenly Father’s will…you will not see adversity as a misfortune.  When keeping your life in accordance with the way our Heavenly Father would have you live, when keeping an eye fixed on the glory of God, and seeing this life for what it really is: a large step taken in a short amount of time to become like our Savior, and like our Heavenly Father, then adversity will not be a misfortune at all.  We will realize that adversity required for growth in this life.  Really…we didn’t even have to come to Earth.  Heavenly Father is perfectly omniscient and He knows the decisions we would have made, He knows us better than anything we can imagine, and He knows all things past, present and future.  Yet…we are here on this Earth. It is a gift from our Heavenly Father that we are here to learn for ourselves.  Adversities…which the world defines as misfortunes are not misfortunes at all.  According to the world, misfortunes are defined as bad luck.   I firmly believe that our adversities have nothing to do with any sort of luck, but all things have their specific purpose in each of our lives.  Of course we will go through difficult and treacherous times, we knew we would before this life and I like to think that we shouted for joy.  Picture it, the Lord gives us an opportunity to become more like Him…yet we know it will be difficult, and it will test our faith and our abilities to be obedient to His loving voice.  But we could see clearly, we had learned Eternal truths that were in the forefronts of our minds, and with that clear Eternal perspective, it was apparent what we should do.  We chose to follow our Father in Heaven…now we are here on the Earth to prove to Him that without His physical presence in our view, we can rely on Him purely by faith…until our faith is perfected and we know.   Adversity is difficult, hard, at times it may seem utterly impossible…but I know in my life, my greatest joys have come from overcoming adversity.  My greatest joys have come from that feeling of growing closer to my Savior, becoming more like Him each day…even though I may be struggling through many situations in life.  I know that I am far from perfect, which is where the atonement comes in.  Doctrine and Covenants 19:16-19 proclaims, “I, God, have suffered these things for all, they might not suffer if they would repent; But if they would not repent they must suffer even as I; Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit – and would bat I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink – Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.” Jesus Christ loves us, which is why He suffered for us.  I picture Him in the Garden of Gethsemane with the weight of every feeling of sorrow, affliction, every trial, temptation…everything, and then I picture Him seeing me, thinking of me while He is suffering.  Saying, “Nathan, my little brother, I love you and I want to be with you for Eternity.”  I too love Him, and I am astounded by His ability to help me, and my Heavenly Father’s ability to forgive me.  I always want to be better, knowing that each time I make a mistake…I am hurting my Savior so much.   As life goes on, as each day continues, and as each trial approaches I think about the scripture in John chapter 14 verse 15, “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”  I do love Him, but do I love Him enough to have it reflect in my actions of everyday life that may seem meaningless and harmless at the time?  I also think about the scripture John 4:19 which says, “We love Him, because He first loved us.”   It is true, if He didn’t love me, if He hadn’t suffered for me, if He wasn’t always there for me, always helping me every step of the way…I probably wouldn’t feel the need to love Him.  But I do love Him, because He first loved me.  And because I love Him…I need to push through every adversity life has to offer with a head held high focusing on the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and His atonement.   One quick story before I close.  At one point in my life several years ago I was faced with an option, an option which held extreme weight of the decision to be made.  I knew that I had been struggling with it for some time, and I wanted to do better…but I couldn’t.  I didn’t understand why I couldn’t.  I would read 1 Corinthians 10:13 which says, “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.” I didn’t understand how He could make that promise.  I knew the scriptures were true, I knew the Gospel was true…and yet I found myself helpless.  Then one night, I knelt by my bedside and humbly prayed the most sincere prayer I ever had.  Saying, “Lord, I cannot do this on my own, I realize that I need thy help. I know that if I jump right now I will fall, but I need to.  So please, help me fly.  Help me overcome this, help me have faith as you already have faith in my abilities.  I love thee, and thank thee for loving me.”  The prayer continued as I prayed, and tears streamed silently down my face in abundance.  I then recognized…something had changed.  Was it because I acknowledged the need of Divine help?  Or simply that I had made the decision to be better?  Or was it that I realized what I needed to do?  I then understood that it was a combination.  I needed the internal will from my very heart to be in the right place, and I had to understand my need for the Savior in my life, and His help.   This Gospel is absolutely true; there is no doubt anywhere in my being.  I love this Gospel, I love my Heavenly Father with all of my heart; I love this Gospel and know that it is true.  I am incessantly astounded by His mercy and His love that is ever so prominent in my life.  I know that the Plan of Salvation is real.  I have prayed about it, wondering if I really would see my brothers and sisters again, and the Holy Ghost made that known to me as well.  I know the Book of Mormon is true.  Every day that I read it I feel the power of those words strengthening my ability to be obedient and triumphant, strengthening my faith in Jesus Christ, and strengthening my love for Him.  I know that, “with the temptation, God will make a way to escape, that we may be able to bear it (1 Corinthians 10:13).”  I know that adversities are for our experience, learning, and will be for our good (D&C 122:7).

 	 what:   'Prophets and the Proclamation In my talk today, I feel the need to convey and expound briefly upon three principles that I know to be true, and that bring joy into my life; they are: Our Heavenly Father loves us. Because of His love for us, our He sends us prophets and apostles. To help us on our journey through this life, He has given us our families.   1.	Our Heavenly Father loves us a.	He is concerned with our happiness and success in life i.	PMG p. 31 – “God is our Heavenly Father. We are His children. He loves us. He weeps with us when we suffer and rejoices when we do what is right. He wants to communicate with us.  We can communicate with Him through sincere prayer. He has given us this experience on the earth so we can learn and grow. We can show our love for Him through our choices and our obedience to His commandments. b.	He knows us and cares for us perfectly i.	Elder Maxwell – October 1987 A universal God is actually involved with our small, individual universes of experience! In the midst of His vast dominions, yet He numbers us, knows us, and loves us perfectly (see Moses 1:35; John 10:14). Along with knowing that God is there, it is equally vital to know what He is like, including His perfected attributes of justice and mercy. … Belief in the goodness and power of God is greatly facilitated by understanding His plan of salvation with its crucial allowance for mankind’s moral agency, real moral agency—with real mistakes and with real consequences! His plan includes real tests, real dilemmas, real anguish, and real joy. 2.	Our Heavenly Father sent us prophets and apostles because He loves us a.	Amos 3:7 i.	Secrets like  1.	Why are we here on the earth? 2.	How can we be happy? 3.	Is there life after death? 4.	How can our families be strong enough to make it through this difficult life together, happily and intact? b.	Just 2 weeks ago, Elder David A. Bednar reminded us of several things previous prophets and apostles taught in their last days. I would like to share some of those things with you.  i.	President Faust – Apr, 2007 1.	“The Savior has offered to all of us a precious peace through His Atonement, but this can come only as we are willing to cast out negative feelings of anger, spite, or revenge. … “Let us remember that we need to forgive to be forgiven. … With all my heart and soul, I believe in the healing power that can come to us as we follow the counsel of the Savior ‘to forgive all men’ [D&C 64:10]” ii.	Elder Wirthlin – Oct 2008 1.	“I still remember [my mother’s] advice to me given on that day long ago when my team lost a football game: ‘Come what may, and love it.’ … Adversity, if handled correctly, can be a blessing in our lives. … As we look for humor, seek for the eternal perspective, understand the principle of compensation, and draw near to our Heavenly Father, we can endure hardship and trial. We can say, as did my mother, ‘Come what may, and love it’” (“Come What May, and Love It,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 28). iii.	President Packer – April 2015 1.	“I bear witness that Jesus is the Christ and the Son of the living God. He stands at the head of the Church. Through His Atonement and the power of the priesthood, families which are begun in mortality can be together through the eternities. … I am so grateful for … the Atonement which can wash clean every stain no matter how difficult or how long or how many times repeated. The Atonement can put you free again to move forward, cleanly and worthily” iv.	Elder Scott – April 2015 1.	“We came to mortal life precisely to grow from trials and testing. Challenges help us become more like our Father in Heaven, and the Atonement of Jesus Christ makes it possible to endure those challenges. I testify that as we actively come unto Him, we can endure every temptation, every heartache, every challenge we face” v.	Elder Perry – April 2015 1.	“Let me close by bearing witness (and my nine decades on this earth fully qualify me to say this) that the older I get, the more I realize that family is the center of life and is the key to eternal happiness. I give thanks for my wife, for my children, for my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren, and for … extended family who make my own life so rich and, yes, even eternal. Of this eternal truth I bear my strongest and most sacred witness” 3.	To lead us safely home, He gave us the Proclamation to the world. a.	PMG p.3 – “On earth, family associations can be the source of some of our greatest joy. Satan is attacking the family on many fronts, and too many families are being destroyed by his efforts. The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ makes it possible for families to be united now and in eternity. By living the principles of the gospel, families can experience peace, joy, and a sense of belonging and identity in this life. Through the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.” b.	Through prophets and apostles, our Heavenly Father gave us the answers to many of the great questions of life in The Family: A Proclamation to the World: i.	Who are we? 1.	ALL HUMAN BEINGS—male and female—are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. Gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose. ii.	Why we are here on the earth? – where were we before? 1.	IN THE PREMORTAL REALM, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life. iii.	How can we be happy? 1.	The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally. iv.	How can families be strong enough to withstand the evils of the world? 1.	THE FAMILY is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity. Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. 4.	Do what matters most Bednar once shared, “At one point I asked Elder Hales, ‘You have been a successful husband, father, athlete, pilot, business executive, and Church leader. What lessons have you learned as you have grown older and been constrained by decreased physical capacity?’ Elder Hales paused for a moment and responded, ‘When you cannot do what you have always done, then you only do what matters most.’” ',

 	{title:  'The Plan of Happiness',
 	 url:    'famTalks/docs/n9-planOfHappiness.pdf',
 	 what:   'The Plan of Happiness Today I wanted to teach several principles from the talk given by President Boyd K. Packer at the most recent General Conference.  His talk was called, “The Plan of Happiness.”  In this talk he taught several things regarding our purpose in life, and how we can find happiness.  Today I would like to expound on several of the things that he taught.  So what exactly does bring us happiness?   Today I would like to focus on several principles that bring us happiness, and how we can better our lives through them. I will be speaking on the importance of the family and the atonement in our search for happiness; and how we can use the temple to bring us nearer to God.  What brings us happiness? 	Family The end of all activity in the Church is to see that a man and a woman with their children are happy at home, sealed together for time and for all eternity. – Packer The commandment to multiply and replenish the earth has never been rescinded. It is essential to the plan of redemption and is the source of human happiness.  Through the righteous exercise of this power, we may come close to our Father in Heaven and experience a fullness of joy, even godhood. The power of procreation is not an incidental part of the plan; it is the plan of happiness; it is the key to happiness.¬¬¬¬¬ The desire to mate in humankind is constant and very strong. Our happiness in mortal life, our joy and exaltation are dependent upon how we respond to these persistent, compelling physical desires. As the procreative power matures in early manhood and womanhood, very personal feelings occur, in a natural way, unlike any other physical experience. Our Heavenly Father has blessed each of us with divine gifts.  Each of us have been foreordained to become parents and to partake in the beautiful blessings of the eternities. As President Packer taught, the way we treat these powers and passions within us will ultimately determine our eternal destiny and happiness.  Our loving Heavenly Father is anxious to help us with any struggles we may have. I have learned for myself that our Heavenly Father loves each of His children and is merciful to all who call on His name.…STOP  As we all know, the opposition is very great.  President Packer taught,  "Temptations are ever present. Because the adversary cannot beget life, he is jealous toward all who have that supernal power. He and those who followed him were cast out and forfeited the right to a mortal body. “He seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). He will tempt, if he can, to degrade, to corrupt, and, if possible, to destroy this gift by which we may, if we are worthy, have eternal increase (see D&C 132:28–31).” – Packer  He continued, “If we pollute our fountains of life or lead others to transgress, there will be penalties more “exquisite” and “hard to bear” (D&C 19:15) than all the physical pleasure could ever be worth.” – Packer “The only legitimate, authorized expression of the powers of procreation is between husband and wife, a man and a woman, who have been legally and lawfully married. Anything other than this violates the commandments of God. Do not yield to the awful temptations of the adversary, for every debt of transgression must be paid “till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing” (Matthew 5:26).” - Packer It is interesting to me that the thing that enables us to experience the greatest joy in this life and through the eternities is also the thing that causes so many to stumble and fall.  In 3 Nephi 18:18 we read, “Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.”  He knows what is at stake, and where our Heavenly Father wants us to be. And I know, that his fight will only make us stronger if we gain a testimony of the atonement of Jesus Christ, and learn to use it in our daily lives.  During this life, we will always make mistakes…but they need not define who we are or restrict our growth. Rather, they should refine who we are and stimulate our growth.  There is hope, my brothers and sisters…for each one of us. We all fall short of the glory of God. We all stand in need of the Lord’s goodness, mercy, and grace.  The atonement of Jesus Christ makes our repentance possible.  Several years ago, President Packer taught,  “There is no habit, no addiction, no rebellion, no transgression, no apostasy, no crime exempted from the promise of complete forgiveness. That is the promise of the atonement of Christ.” – Packer Atonement The atonement of Jesus Christ is key to our happiness in this perfect plan of our Heavenly Father.  We have been blessed with the power to create life, and nurture one another.  We have been blessed with the opportunity to have family and to learn and grow with one another. Through the atonement, and only through the atonement we can return to live in the presence of our Heavenly Father with our eternal families forever, and ever. 	I would like to share with you counsel and teachings given by servants of God in regard to the atonement of Jesus Christ. Elder Tad R. Callister taught how one can use the atonement to purify their life. He said, “If we have made moral mistakes in our lives, we can repent because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. The first and foundational step to living a morally clean life for the future is to repent of past transgressions, to exchange a foundation of sand for a foundation of rock. Often that commences with confession.” 	Elder Holland taught how we can make the atonement an integral part of our lives. He taught, “Seek the counsel of those who hold keys for your spiritual well-being. Ask for and cherish priesthood blessings. Take the sacrament every week, and hold fast to the perfecting promises of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.” Elder Bednar taught how we can use the atonement not only to overcome sin, but to prepare us to return to God: “Not only does the Atonement of Jesus Christ overcome the effects of the Fall of Adam and make possible the remission of our individual sins and transgressions, but His Atonement also enables us to do good and become better in ways that stretch far beyond our mortal capacities.” – Bednar How do we find happiness in this life?  We find happiness through learning about Jesus Christ, and His atonement…then learning how to use His atonement in our daily lives to purify and eventually perfect us.  As we repent and draw nearer to God, He will pour down blessings on us that we could never have even imagined.   Sincere repentance prepares us for the greatest blessings of God. Repentance prepares us to enter the house of the Lord, and worship in the temple.  Temple The temple is a manifestation of the Lord’s love for us.  Through it we can receive strength and direction in our daily lives and draw nearer to God.  When I attend the temple, I feel a special spirit there that is unlike anything else in this world.  Just yesterday, my wife and I went there with our beautiful daughter just to be in the waiting room together to study the scriptures.  Hannah is growing up fast but isn’t quite ready for an official temple recommend.  Anyways, we drove up to the temple…parked the car and started to walk across the parking lot to the temple.  Before we even entered the gates, I could already feel a special spirit….witnessing to me that the temple is indeed the house of the Lord  and was exactly where the Lord wanted us to be. The Lord stands ready and desirous to bless us…we just need to come unto Him.  Understanding the Plan of Happiness, and accessing the power of the atonement allows us to stand before Him without guilt and with joy.  True happiness is found as we come unto the Lord through faithful obedience to all of His commandments. President Monson testified, 	 		“I think there is no place in the world where I feel closer to the Lord than in one of His holy temples.” – Monson 	As he continued, he said,  	“As we go to the holy house, as we remember the covenants we make therein, we will be able to bear every trial and overcome each temptation. The temple provides purpose for our lives. It brings peace to our souls—not the peace provided by men but the peace promised by the Son of God when He said, ‘Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.’” – Monson What a promise that is.  To know that by attending the temple and remembering the covenants made there, we will be able to bear every trial and overcome each temptation.  The Lord stands ready to offer us His strength and guidance. It is through the temple that we can receive all of the blessings made possible by the atonement. It is through the temple that we can receive the greatest blessings of God that will prepare us for eternal life in His presence.  President Packer also taught of the importance of the temple when he said, 	“When members of the Church are troubled or when crucial decisions weigh heavily upon their minds, it is a common thing for them to go to the temple. It is a good place to take our cares. In the temple we can receive spiritual perspective. There, during the time of the temple service, we are ‘out of the world.’  Sometimes our minds are so beset with problems, and there are so many things clamoring for attention at once that we just cannot think clearly and see clearly. At the temple the dust of distraction seems to settle out, the fog and the haze seem to lift, and we can ‘see’ things that we were not able to see before and find a way through our troubles that we had not previously known. The Lord will bless us as we attend to the sacred ordinance work of the temples. Blessings there will not be limited to our temple service. We will be blessed in all of our affairs” – Packer ',

 	 what:   'Happiness and Enduring to the End Good morning everyone. I’m very grateful for this opportunity to speak to you today and hope that the Spirit will teach you and me. I would like to begin my talk sharing a story told by Elder Ballard about a year and a half ago. He speaks about one of his friend’s that went white water rafting on the Colorado River in Cataract Canyon. "At the beginning of the trip, one of the experienced river guides reviewed important safety instructions, emphasizing three rules that would ensure the group’s safe travel through the rapids. "Rule number one: stay in the boat! Rule number two: always wear a life jacket! Rule number three: always hold on with both hands!" He then said again, with even more emphasis, ’Above all, remember rule number one: stay in the boat!’ This adventure reminds me of our mortal journey. Most of us experience periods in our lives where the tranquil waters of life are appreciated. At other times, we encounter white-water rapids that are metaphorically comparable to those found in the 14-mile stretch through Cataract Canyon—challenges that may include physical and mental health issues, the death of a loved one, dashed dreams and hopes, and—for some—even a crisis of faith when faced with life’s problems, questions, and doubts." As I studied his talk, I was continually impressed by this metaphor. I thought about how these three rules could relate to a principle found in 2 Nephi chapter 31. Nephi was teaching us and those he loved about the doctrine of Jesus Christ. He taught that we must follow our Savior Jesus Christ through faith, and repentance. He also taught that repentance prepares us for baptism by immersion and for the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. After which, he said, "18 And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive. 19 And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save." It is interesting how life works sometimes. It can be extremely difficult, and in those times of difficulty sometimes a lot is asked of us. I believe that there is divine purpose in the difficulty of life. I believe that our Heavenly Father loves us dearly and that He truly wants us to be happy. I also believe that He gives us what we need to be happy. Going back to Nephi’s question, if all has been done after being baptized. He said ’no’ pretty clearly, but then he taught us something profound, he said, "for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save." Now, when I stopped to think about that, I wondered what that has to do with the question he just asked. It’s like he said, Is everything done? No, you got here by following Jesus Christ in faith. As if implying that because we followed Jesus Christ, we really shouldn’t want to be done. He also said, "Relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save." I think that most of us have felt the peace, strength, and joy that come through relying on the Savior and following Him in faith. If we have felt that joy and peace from Him who is mighty to save, why would we want to go any other direction? Why would we want to stop acting in faith? Why would we want to be done, and go off our own way? Perhaps it is because sometimes the other path is easier. Perhaps it is because the other path has things that look fun, or exciting. Regardless of what it is, I have noticed that the more I look at another path, the more disconnected I become from the path the Savior. Perhaps I haven’t even taken a step yet...but if my heart is lingering elsewhere, it will soon forget the peace, strength and joy that accompany the Savior’s path. So again, Nephi asks if all is done. The truth is, our Heavenly Father has an entire life prepared for us, full of joy, and happiness that is possible through faith in Jesus Christ. We learned from Lehi that we exist, that we might have joy. I know that joy comes through following our Savior and through being obedient to his commandments. President Uchtdorf taught, "But to what end were we created? We were created with the express purpose and potential of experiencing a fulness of joy. Our birthright—and the purpose of our great voyage on this earth—is to seek and experience eternal happiness." So I ask you, what brings happiness? The speakers who have spoken in this meeting have taught very well about enduring to the end. Continuing in Elder Ballard’s talk, he talked about how we need to stay in the boat, likening it to staying in the Gospel whether times were easy or difficult and despite the immense challenges we face in these days. He declared, "We need to experience a continuing conversion by increasing our faith in Jesus Christ and our faithfulness to His gospel throughout our lives—not just once but regularly. Alma asked, ’And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren [and sisters], if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?’" That change of heart that Alma referred to, often goes hand in hand with the peace, strength and joy that I mentioned a few minutes ago. In the continuous tumult of our lives, it is easy to forget what it felt like to enter into sacred covenants with our Heavenly Father; or what it felt like to act in faithful obedience relying wholly upon the Lord and His power in the midst of temptation. It is often easy to forget that we are children of a King, destined to experience the joy and the life that He does; and that He has prepared the way for us to return to His presence, both prepared and worthy to receive all that He hath - through Jesus Christ. In Helaman 5 we read, "9 O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world." And so it is with us, of vital importance that we remember our Savior always. For this purpose, we come to partake of the sacrament every week, and so that through Him we can be made clean again. Jesus Christ taught, "And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you. (3 Ne. 18:7)" . What an incredible promise. By faithfully seeking to ’always remember Him,’ we can experience a continuous conversion like Elder Ballard taught, by increasing our faith in Jesus Christ - not just once, but regularly. This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God. Life is meant to be full of challenges of all sorts and sizes that test our faith...but if we can remember that we are children of God, destined to receive His greatness, then we can continually grow in faith, continually draw nearer unto God, and essentially fulfill our purpose here in this mortal journey becoming prepared to meet God. I know that as we act in faith, He will be with us because He wants us to succeed and wants us to be happy. I know that even though life is difficult, it is meant to be enjoyed. Nephi asked, if all has been done...I say unto you, nay. The Lord still has wonders to work in our lives, and in our very natures. He desires to prepare us for Eternal Life. If we act in faith, seeking continual conversion through Jesus Christ, then our Heavenly Father will be able to prepare us for Eternal Life, and we will experience a fullness of joy. I know that these things are true. They bring me hope and strength in my times of need. I invite all of us to ponder upon the things the Spirit has taught us this day, that we may know what we must do to more fully come unto Christ in our personal lives. I know that as we seek to do this, our Heavenly Father will not only bless us with inspiration to know what to do or change in our lives, but also with the strength and capacity to do so. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. If there is time... I would like to suggest five things that have brought happiness to me in my life, things that we can choose to do on a regular basis. 1.	Pray often 1.	We are God’s children. He loves us dearly. He wants to teach us. He wants us to communicate with Him. He loves listening to our stories and the things that are important to us. Our bond with Him is essential in us finding true and lasting happiness. 2.	Feast upon the scriptures 1.	For us to continually draw nearer to God, we need to continually learn about Him through scripture study. Scripture study invites the Holy Ghost, and the Holy Ghost testifies of our Savior and Heavenly Father. Through scripture study we can not only learn the will of God, but can be blessed with inspiration for our lives, and about our existence. 3.	Attend the temple 1.	We are fortunate to live in a day when there are temples. We are blessed to be able to go to the temple and worship our Heavenly Father. President Monson said, "I think there is no place in the world where I feel closer to the Lord than in one of His holy temples." We would do well to take advantage of this incredible opportunity to learn more about the Savior, and receive strength from on high. 4.	Love and serve God 1.	President Uchtdorf continued in his same talk and said, "As we lose ourselves in the service of others, we discover our own lives and our own happiness." We have been taught that through serving our fellow beings, we are only in the service of God. This not only blesses the lives of those around us and those we serve, but it also allows the Lord to bless our lives more fully. 5.	Spend quality time with family 1.	President Uchtdorf taught , "Since ’no other success can compensate for failure [in the home]’, we must place high priority on our families. We build deep and loving family relationships by doing simple things together, like family dinner and family home evening and by just having fun together. In family relationships love is really spelled t-i-m-e, time. Taking time for each other is the key for harmony at home. We talk with, rather than about, each other. We learn from each other, and we appreciate our differences as well as our commonalities. We establish a divine bond with each other as we approach God together through family prayer, gospel study, and Sunday worship." There is great joy to be found in being united as a family and in seeking the Lord together. ',

 	 url:    'famTalks/docs/n11-pioneers.pdf',
 	 what:   'Talk on Pioneers As I have prepared this talk, I have felt motivation to change and better my own life and I’m excited to share some of my thoughts on these things that I’ve learned.  I pray that the Spirit will be here to teach each of us, and that we may be open and accepting to His teachings. Throughout my talk today, I wish to share several stories of pioneer experiences.  It is my hope, that each one of these stories will help us to better understand our own journey through this life, and how we can be successful in navigating it.  Eliza R. Snow was a pioneer that had an interesting first night on the trek.  She said that on the first evening of their journey, nine children were born.  I can’t even imagine having a baby the first night away from civilization...or leaving civilization knowing my wife’s due date is coming up.  But these nine kiddos that were born that first night, were just a small number of the many children that were born during journeys across the plains.  Zina D.H. Young, gave birth in the back of a covered wagon. She halted the march of the company when it happened. Though the birthing conditions were far from ideal, these mothers carried on. Zina said that “I did not mind the hardship of my situation, for my life had been preserved, and my babe seemed so beautiful.” (Ensign article “Courage—The Unfailing Beacon”). These simple stories about delivering children during this journey caused me to ponder much on the faith of these women, and many other pioneers in similar situations.  How much courage and faith must they and their husbands of had to be able to embark on this journey and continue each day?  Of course it would have been physically trying, but I’m sure that the emotional weight at times seemed too much to bear.  The faith of these people is inspiring to us today.  It reminds me of a scripture found in Proverbs. It reads: 1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  (Proverbs 3) These pioneers knew the value of keeping the commandments of God.  For despite their exceeding trials, they were able to find peace through the atonement of Jesus Christ.  This peace is a result of faithfully following the example of Jesus Christ and is a promised blessing to those who follow him in faith.  I think of the way these pioneer women chose to embark on this journey knowing they were about to give birth. And if that wasn’t a large enough trial of their faith…nine of them gave birth that first night.  It would not surprise me if there were moments when individuals would say to themselves, “holy cow…if this is happening on the first night, what is going to happen over the coming months? ...maybe we should stop while we’re ahead.”  But, whether they realized it or not at the time…opposition is one of our greatest blessings in this life. As I ponder on my own life and on the experiences that I have both had and witnessed, I realize that life has a lot of challenges, and plenty of opposition for all.  From the Book of Mormon, it was Lehi who taught his children, 11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. And so it is with us: no opposition means no trial, no growth, no purpose, and even somewhat meaningless choices in life.  Opposition is a blessing because when faced with faith in the Lord, Jesus Christ, it is what builds our character and brings us unto Him. It is what helps us to experience joy in this life and value the things that we have.  These pioneers suffered much, and experienced much opposition. Their stories of faith in spite of opposition, inspire all who hear them.  May we remember the example of these mothers: to be strong in the face of opposition.   My next story is of a woman named Susanna Stone.  “I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints about the year 1848. This caused my heart to rejoice. I have seen that the hand of the Lord has been over me for good from my earliest childhood and I know that his Holy Spirit has been my constant guide and companion. I never shall forget the many manifestations of the Lord’s goodness and blessings unto me and mine.” Susannah Stone was the only member of her family to join the Church. At the age of 25, despite the protests of family and friends, she left to go to America and joined the Willie Handcart company. She says that “only once did my courage fail.” It was at a time when she was alone and her feet had become frosted over and she stopped and “sat down to await the end.”  She then recounts, “After a time I was aroused by a voice, which seemed as audible as anything could be, and which spoke to my very soul of the promises and blessings I had received and that I had a mission to perform in Zion. I received strength, and was filled with the Spirit of the Lord and arose and traveled on with a light heart.” When she reached camp, Susannah found a search party ready to go look for her. She continued on the trek, and the day she reached the valley was also the day she met her future husband, Thomas Lloyd. Susannah would have 14 children, and become Relief Society secretary. In the brief moment that we’ve learned about Susanna just now, there are many things about her and her character that would be good for us to emulate in our own lives.  I wish to emphasize the way in which she chose to be strong in the face of opposition.  She was ready to die and thought that she was going to.  When the Spirit spoke to her, she chose to get up and carry on.  She mentioned that her courage failed…but apparently it was only for a moment.  What helped her in this time of need was the Lord and the enabling power of the atonement.  Elder Bednar, in teaching about the atonement and how it can be used in our lives said the following, “I frankly do not think many of us ‘get it’ concerning [the] enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement, and I wonder if we mistakenly believe we must make the journey from good to better and become a saint all by ourselves through sheer grit, willpower, and discipline, and with our obviously limited capacities.” He then taught, “In the Bible Dictionary we learn that the word grace frequently is used in the scriptures to connote a strengthening or enabling power: “The main idea of the word is divine means of help or strength, given through the bounteous mercy and love of Jesus Christ. “… It is likewise through the grace of the Lord that individuals, through faith in the atonement of Jesus Christ and repentance of their sins, receive strength and assistance to do good works that they otherwise would not be able to maintain if left to their own means. This grace is an enabling power that allows men and women to lay hold on eternal life and exaltation after they have expended their own best efforts” (p. 697). Thus, the enabling and strengthening aspect of the Atonement helps us to see and to do and to become good in ways that we could never recognize or accomplish with our limited mortal capacity. I testify and witness that the enabling power of the Savior’s Atonement is real. Without that strengthening power of the Atonement, I could not stand before you this morning. Can we see this in the story of Susannah Stone?  She was about to die. She didn’t have any more strength to continue on…but through the atonement, she did.  There were two things that happened that allowed her to survive, and eventually make it to Zion and bear 14 children.  •	First: the Lord helped to strengthen her through the power of the Atonement. •	Second: she chose to get up and keep going. Had either one of these not been present in that moment, she would have died there.  So it is in our lives.  Our lives are made up of moments. And moments boil down to decisions.  If we choose to follow the Savior in faith, then we will come to know a similar peace and joy that the pioneers experienced when reaching their destination.  The Lord is always reaching out to us. He knows what we are feeling. He knows what we’re struggling with.  He knows our deepest desires and our most dreaded fears.  There are many instances throughout the scriptures, particularly in Isaiah, where we learn of a people messing up big time, and then we see the words, “For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.”  I am continually humbled by the greatness and mercy of God.  I am continually humbled by His love for me, and the fact that His hand is always stretched out towards me.  In the home that I grew up in, we have a large painting of the Savior.  In it, there is a beautiful river full of large rocks and white water. Towards the bottom of the picture, there is a little girl stretching on her toes reaching upward with one hand, while her other is propped on a higher rock.  Above her, is the Savior, holding a small boy with his left arm, and reaching down with his right hand, managing to reach her and seems to be pulling her up to him.  Like her, sometimes we find ourselves in perilous situations.  Whether it is just the difficulties of life, or whether we made some mistakes that put us there…it doesn’t matter, the Lord’s hand is always extended to us.  May we learn from the example of Susannah Stone: to choose to take the Lord’s hand, to get up and to keep going.   The third story that I would like to mention, was shared by Sarah.  I would like to share just the last piece of it: “Three eighteen-year-old boys belonging to the relief party came to the rescue, and to the astonishment of all who saw, carried nearly every member of the ill-fated handcart company across the snowbound stream. The strain was so terrible, and the exposure so great, that in later years all the boys died from the effects of it. When President Brigham Young heard of this heroic act, he wept like a child, and later declared publicly, ‘that act alone will ensure C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant, and David P. Kimball an everlasting salvation in the Celestial Kingdom of God, worlds without end.’” (Solomon F. Kimball, Improvement Era, Feb. 1914, p. 288.) Each time I hear this story, I wonder what the people felt when they saw that they would be able to continue their journey, because of the goodness of these young men.  I wonder what kinds of things they said to the young men before getting picked up, and after making it across the river.  But I also wonder what these three young men felt as they provided this incredibly selfless and loving service to this group of people.  I imagine that it was a similar feeling to that of a missionary leaving their home for some time to go serve the Lord, or individuals in daily life who selflessly give to others because of their Christ-like love.  Mormon taught that, “every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ (Moroni 7:16).”  As we choose to take hold of every good thing, we will become children of Christ.  His Spirit will be with us always, not only to influence how we feel and how we act.  But it will also purify us, and bring about a continual change in us that will bring us closer and closer to the Savior of the world.  I believe that these three young men had done their best to follow the example of their Savior.  I believe that because of their acts of faith long before this moment in time, they were prepared in that moment to love these people as Christ did, and to give their lives for them as Christ did.  Brothers and sisters, the purpose of life is not only to receive a body and be tested.  The purpose of this life is to prepare to meet God.  We do this by making covenants with our Heavenly Father, and being faithful to those covenants through the rest of our lives.  This will bring about the change that I mentioned a moment ago, of becoming children of Christ, of becoming pure as He is, of becoming more and more like He is.  Jesus Christ commanded, “Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is perfect. (3 Nephi 12:48).”  This happens through choosing to act in faith in the simple moments that make up a lifetime.  So any time there is a simple moment in life that presents a bit of opposition, know that if you choose the right, you are taking a step towards God. You are training yourself to be obedient to His word even when it is hard, or seemingly unimportant; you are showing Him that you want and are worthy of His Spirit.  May we learn from these three boys that following in the footsteps of the Savior, will ultimately lead us to Him and will enable us to return to His presence and receive the greatest of all the gifts of God: Eternal Life.   Each one of these stories actually happened.  They happened here, in this land, not very long ago.  Remembering these and other stories like them can help us live the gospel of Jesus Christ.  As I studied for this talk, I felt powerful impressions while reading through many pioneer stories, and I could feel the Spirit of God testifying to me of truth.  I think one of the reasons why they are so powerful to us is because in a way, we are pioneers.  Elder Oaks asked the prompting question, “Do you, like the pioneers, have the courage and the consistency to be true to the faith and endure to the end? (Oct. 1997 – Following the Pioneers).”  END QUOTE!!! Thankfully, we do not have to push handcarts across a country.  But the spiritual equivalent to all the wickedness we face in the world, is like pulling a handcart up Mount Everest…with all of our modern appliances in it.  We live in a very wicked world.  In a book Elder Maxwell wrote called Notwithstanding My Weakness, he taught, “Though we have rightly applauded our ancestors for their spiritual achievements (and do not and must not discount them now), those of us who prevail today will have done no small thing. The special spirits who have been reserved to live in this time of challenges and who overcome will one day be praised for their stamina by those who pulled handcarts. (18)” So any time we are overcome with burdens and feel like we are in the bitter winters some of the pioneers faced, let us remember these principles from these stories. 1.	From the example of the mothers – Let us be strong in opposition. 2.	From the example Susannah Stone - Choose to take the Lord’s hand, to get up and to keep going. He will always provide a way for us to succeed. 3.	From the story of C. Allen Huntington, George W. Grant, and David P. Kimball - Following in the footsteps of the Savior, will ultimately lead us to Him. I know that these principles are true.  I know because I have felt the joy and peace that come through living them in my own life.  I am very far from where I want to be, but I am continually reminded by a loving Heavenly Father of who He wants me to be, and who…with His help, I can become.  It is not easy to stay strong in the midst of opposition or temptation.  But…it is worth it.  It is possible.  With the Lord, anything is possible.  His hand is always extended to us. We would be wise to reach for it, and hold onto it for dear life.  With the wickedness of the world increasing every day, we need our Savior as our lifeline. He is the only way by which we can know peace in this world, and eternal happiness throughout the eternities.  I love my Savior.  I love my Heavenly Father.  I want to be the best I can so that I can live with them again, and so that I can live with my precious family forever.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. ',
